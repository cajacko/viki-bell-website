As I travelled up to Gloucestershire earlier this year I began planning how I was going to begin this blog. There seemed no better way to start it off with a post about a couple’s new beginning. ![IMG_0910](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0910-1024x768.jpg) Charlie and I were on a three-hour train journey through the beautiful fields of Gloucestershire for Sami and Sophie’s wedding. It was the first we had been to that we could really appreciate (meaning we were old enough to get fully involved!) and remember all the finer details. From the moment Sophie made her elegant walk down the aisle and Sami said ‘Oh!’ to the moment they glided around the dance floor in their first dance, the day was beautiful.   The ceremony was lovely and everyone enjoyed belting out the old hymns. The flowers throughout the church were really pretty and had been created by Sophie's mum adding that homemade touch. After the canepes in the garden and a yummy buffet meal it was time to dance. Sami and Sophie had made a great choice with a swing band- everyone was up dancing and spinning around the room. ![IMG_0954](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0954-768x1024.jpg) Weddings are interesting events; you gain an insight into the person and their family. The day is full of smiles and happiness. The moments you share with the two families are moments that stay forever.

      "wordpressContent": "With wedding planning underway the summer has been none stop. The best part so far has been the excuse to make trips up to Suffolk almost every weekend. Let me introduce why Suffolk is so important to me... ![IMG_0091](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0091-1024x682.jpg)As the A12 opens up to never-ending fields and we arrive in Thorpeness, I always get a sense of excitement. Tucked neatly down a secretive track is the Cottage we stay in. There is always someone coming or going here, neighbours knocking on the door for dinner and unexpected boat trips. Suffolk is, to me, one of the most magical places. You don’t plan what to do here but you know you will always be doing one thing or another. [![IMG_0260](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0260-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0260.jpg) I've been going to the Cottage since I was 14/15 when I used to camp out in the field surrounded by all my closest friends. We would ride bikes, swim in the sea and build giant bonfires. The trips I made up here were completely different to how I spent my time at home. I remember Woo and I would spontaneously dress up and make the strangest cocktails out of whatever we could find. Carnival during August was always a main event up here. We would go and watch the floats during the day then sit on the beach at night watching the fireworks. Suffolk provides the best kind of escape from London and is just the thing to revive your creativeness. We’ve shared this place with all sorts of friends who have each found their own way to enjoy it. From Gee playing his guitar in the middle of a field to Jay drafting scripts - it seems only natural to host our big day up here. After exploring numerous wedding venues across Essex and Suffolk we've finally found our ‘one’. It’s just 15 minutes from the Cottage and has the sort of quirky, country house feel to it that I just love around here. If you ever get the chance to visit the Thorpeness / Aldeburgh area make sure you do. ![IMG_0108](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0108-1024x682.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Charlie and I had arranged to meet up with our friend Jub Jub, who we hadn't seen for ages. With most of our friends still based in Essex we usually meet up with them around Liverpool street. I always struggle to think of new places to go which aren't too far from the station. I didn't realise there was a [La Tasca](http://latasca.com) so close. The dark, underground atmosphere seemed like a great place to hear all of his crazy stories which ranged from cheerleading to spending time on construction sites. ![La Tasca](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1521-225x300.jpg) I don't think I can remember having ever been to La Tasca so my first trip there was really pleasant. La Tasca seems like the standard [Prezzo](http://www.prezzorestaurants.co.uk)/ [Zizzis](http://www.zizzi.co.uk) chain but I quite liked that it brings a Spanish twist to the Italian dominated food market. I took advantage of O2 priority and used my 25% off code which made the meal super cheap - especially so near to the city. We decided to share everything and had with olives and bread for starter followed by seafood paella. My only fault was that we asked for chorizo in the paella but never got it, other than that it was a really delicious meal. Next time I go I think I'd try out some of the tapas dishes - I skimmed the menu and I could have eaten everything on there! My favourite type of meals are when you get a little bit of a lot of dishes. [![La Tasca](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1525-300x225.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1525.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "For the past four years we've hosted the Wood Party. It's becoming a bit of a tradition and stems from when we used to spend so much time in Suffolk when we were all younger. It's a great chance to get all sorts of friends together for one big night together. We all arrive in a private woodland in the absolute middle of nowhere and set up for a magical evening. We decorate the clearing with tents, hammocks, a fire and fairy lights. Each year the amount of people grows and each year it gets better. Volleyball, face painting, vodka haribo (it's a thing?), strobe lighting, dancing, acrobatics, BBQs, bonfires and DJs have all featured at the party one time or another. ![10570365_10152671547738767_4987122103683071032_n](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10570365_10152671547738767_4987122103683071032_n-225x300.jpg) ![IMG_3507](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_3507-224x300.jpg) As the sun begins to set and the music gets cranked up the dancing begins. The different sets of friend spread between Charlie, Woo and I all mesh together and have a great time. Sure the woods may seem like a bit of a creepy place to spend the night, and be the perfect setting for a horror film but each year we come away, slightly worst for wear, with a smile on our face and a great story to tell. Don't worry your invite for next year is in the post! ![P1000041](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1000041-1024x768.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "I remember being on the school swimming team waiting at the side for my race. I would always do front crawl, sometimes the other strokes but mainly front crawl. I'd LOVE that rush you get as you dive in for a race, the power you feel as you propel yourself through the water and that adrenaline always had me hyped up afterwards. I learnt to dive and tumble turn pretty late on but luckily my stroke and breathing techniques made sure I kept up with the team. I loved racing and that 30 seconds of screaming someones name in encouragement and they smash through the water.\n\nSwimming makes me feel great - so why don't I go swimming more often? It's a question I've asked myself for a while now and I think it all comes down to laziness. I'd love to swim but unless I have someone to encourage to swim or someone to encourage me it simply doesn't happen. I end up bringing in my kit and leaving it under my desk at work, or finding some excuse why I can't take an hour out of my day for a dip.\n\nHaving a wedding in about eight months is the perfect excuse, everyone talks about getting fit for a wedding but you won't catch me in a gym in a million years! I've found some swimming buddies and last night was my first swim in (roughly) three years. It felt amazing! I may have pulled some muscles in my arm by being a bit too over enthusiastic but it was worth it. Swimming lengths gives me an excuse to shut down my brain and stop thinking about everything - especially my wedding to do list! I found an [app by Speedo](http://www.speedo.co.uk/speedo-fit-app) where you can set yourself length goals so I'll be trying that out and seeing how far I can go in one session. All I need now is some practice and I'll be a fish in no time....",

I've been there once before (possibly for my birthday) and remembered it was great food so I was really looking forward to it.\n\nThe banter was on a high as my brother and his friend kept cracking jokes through the meal. I'd forgotten what 16 year old boy talk was like!\n\nI had heard that most of the staff were in collage and that definitively showed. Our waiter obviously had some experience but still seemed quite rude to us at times. The food more than made up for the service though; I wanted to try nearly everything on the menu.\n\n[![IMG_1549](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1549-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1549.jpg)To start I had the Masons salad which is a mixture of rocket, sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts and blue cheese this was followed by fillet steak partnered with a strange but delicious looking potato cake and the sweetest onions I've ever tasted. The steak was amazing, normally when I ask for it blue it arrives fairly cooked but this was perfect. The evening was topped off with mango and passionfruit sorbet.\n\n[![IMG_1556](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1556-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1556.jpg)\n\nFull and more than satisfied we made our way home.

I'm not the sort of girl who likes to get a facial or a pedicure; I just can't sit still for long enough!\n\nAfter almost a year of trying to organise a day we finally booked it for the day before mums birthday. Off we went to [Clarice House](http://www.claricehouse.co.uk/) in Colchester. This is based in an old country home packed full of individual therapy rooms and a multitude of beauticians. They also have a pool with steam sauna and something called a eucalyptus room which you can use throughout the day.\n\nWe tried out plenty of treatments starting with a full body massage followed by a swim then a leg treatment, facial, lunch and finally a manicure and pedicure. We managed to pack a lot into the day.\n\nMy favourite treatment was probably the massage as the beautician doing it worked really hard on my back. The facial was also lovely except for the fact I fell asleep during my head massage - opps!\n\n![IMG_1575](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_1575-225x300.jpg)Lunch was all pre booked and served up very speedily in the dining room.

First impressions were fantastic - the reception was giant with columns all around and backlit fountains.

There is far too much to include in one blog post so I'll give you some highlights over the next few posts.\n\n_The food_\n\nWith seven different restaurants to choose from we were spoilt for choice. A few of the places called for men to be in trousers and shirts which was a nice excuse to get a bit dressed up. My favourite places were Aqua or Vento (both did amazing steak). Typical food in the Dominican Republic is rice and chicken so of course there was plenty of this on offer. I personally took advantage of the amount of steak on the menus and the all inclusive sushi. My last lunch may have bean steak and sushi! [![IMG_4551](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4551-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4551.jpg)\n\nIf you're considering going to the Dominican Republic then go! It's a great island and everyone is really friendly. There is plenty of excursions to do but be aware that everyone will want a recommendation on Trip Advisor! The Dominican Republic is a great island to visit if you get the chance. Just be sure to fully research any excursions as there are plenty on offer. I'd definitely recommend the [Outback tour](http://vikibell.com/the-outback-tour/ \"The Outback Tour\"). You can read more about the [Bavaro Splash](http://vikibell.com/bavaro-splash/) trip we took and [the shows](http://vikibell.com/the-shows/) we saw.\n\nUntil next time.... [![IMG_4526](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4526-682x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4526.jpg)",

The majority of tourists to the Dominican Republic are American so it was no surprise we were the only Brits on the bus. We all got chatting about our countries and we faced the 20 Brit questions (how often do you drink tea? Do you know the Queen?) One even said I sound like the Queen and Charlie looks like Will! ![IMG_4699](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4699-1024x682.jpg)\n\nOur fist stop was a local school. Here the government pays for the school building and the teacher but anything else like teaching supplies you have to buy yourself. This is where the outback tour comes in, it pays the school a little money in order to see the class room. This then buys books and stationary the kids need.\n\n[![IMG_4698](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4698-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4698.jpg)\n\nAfter the school we headed up the mountain to the outback huts. We were given a tour of the local vegetation showing is aloe Vera, basil, vanilla, coco and coffee beans amongst others. We also saw a cigar shack where the boy was rolling them with various flavourings. Did you know the tobacco factories pay for the middle bit of the leaf which is left out from a tobacco cigar. Why? Because it has 60% of the tobacco!\n\n[![IMG_4743](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4743-682x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4743.jpg)\n\nAfter a Local lunch of Dominican fried chicken and rice we saw and alligator, iguana, crocodile, flamingos and some local shops where we bought some mamajauana. We then headed down the mountain towards a local home. [![IMG_4756](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4756-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4756.jpg)\n\nThis was really brightly coloured and consisted of two shacks. One had two bedrooms a lounge and a work room; the other had a kitchen and the finest kitten if ever seen! There was where we were given a demonstration of how coffee is made (yum!) as well as vanilla, sugar cane and various ways of using the coco plant including chocolate of course.\n\n[![IMG_4760](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4760-1024x837.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4760.jpg)Then it was off to the beach. As tourism boomed on the island all the beaches have remained public. The only problem is that you can't get to them as the resorts take up all the space in front. We were heading to the last accessible beach in punta Cana which just so happened to be great for body boarding. I flung off my stuff and headed down to the waves to be crushed and whirled around - I seriously felt like I was 8 again! ![IMG_4801](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_48011-1024x801.jpg)\n\nThe day was topped off with a few too many rum and lemonades and a lot of stories to tell.",

      "wordpressContent": "For our second excursion we'd chosen something water based. [Bavaro Splash](http://oceanadventures-puntacana.com/bavaro-splash.html) was the perfect combination of my desire to snorkel and Matthews need to drive a speed boat. On Thursday after lunch we were collected and taken for a safety briefing. After this we found ourselves on a boat headed for the offshore reef. Our group was first to snuba. I hadn't heard of snuba before but it was soon explained that it's a form of diving that combines both snorkelling and scuba diving by supplying your oxygen through a long tube to a breathing device. At first I wasn't sure about how the pressure would feel but we only went down around 5 metres so it was fine. The guide, Wilkins, took my camera and took plenty of photos of us all on the chairs, feeding fish and holding a sea urchin. [![P1030578](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P10305781-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P10305781.jpg) After snuba we stayed in the sea to do some snorkelling. This part wasn't as fun but there were plenty of fish swimming around. One even treated me like a whale and was swimming alongside me for ages - not sure I like being compared to a whale! It was really nice to explore the reef and see the different fish swimming around. We had some bread with us to feed them too, although one bite my finger! [![P1030624](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1030624-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1030624.jpg) Our final activity of the day was speed boating. We each paired up and got given a boat along with instructions of what not to do. I went first and was smashing our boat into the biggest waves and flinging us around the coast line. Of course I may have forgotten that we weren't supposed to \"zig zag\" it across waves and was a little violent with the driving, but it was all good  Matthew's turn was up and, after an initial stall, he managed to get to grips with the driving. He really had a great time! This was an excellent activity to end on as the sun was setting and the island looked beautiful. After we got back to shore we decided to walk back along the beach to our hotel. It was a really lovely afternoon trip.

Of course you can never expect a west end quality performance but you can have some fun watching the reps bounce around doing routines they know inside and out. At the Paradisus it was no different; each evening the reps would put on a show, either on the stage or around the courtyard. Our favourite shows were by far the Jazz and electro ones. The Jazz night had a lady singing accompanied with a band. She sung all the hits from Nancy Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra. The reps all did a dance routine for some of them and of course the singer acted very tipsy for _One more for the road_ - although I don't think some people understood as they seemed to leave in disgust! [![IMG_4377](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4377-1024x744.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4377.jpg) When we arrived at the electro night we were very confused. Angel (one of the reps) was painting around another of the reps on a giant board but was all neon and looked great with the glow of the light. The band suddenly struck up and a saxophone player begun walking around the crowd playing. This was followed by a bartender showing us various tricks as he made cocktails. Now it was our turn. The reps all came round and picked people to go up and copy one of them who was twirking in order to win a cocktail. After Charlie volunteered me, I found myself in the centre of the audience making some sort of attempt to dance. Thankfully I was good enough to get a cocktail! Then they carried on playing electro swing hits whilst people were up dancing. We're seeing a [Parov Stelar](http://vikibell.com/parov-stelar/) in a few weeks so if this hasn't got us excited I don't know what will![![IMG_4453](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4453-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4453.jpg)",

If you constantly say no to trying out new stuff, you'll find yourself ageing into a very boring story. I've been reading a book called [Stuffocation](http://stuffocation.org/the-book/) by James Wallman and these thoughts keep cropping up.\n\nStuffocation is pretty much what it says on the tin; a book about how we, as a society, have too much stuff. It's made me begin to question the things I have lying around in my flat. Why do I need fifteen or so candle holders and 5 different salt and pepper shakers? Are we not better to spend our time and money doing new things rather than accruing more stuff?\n\nThink about what you talk about and the stories you tell- is that new dress really going to give you an experience you tell your grandkids about? Or would you be better to spend it on trying a new class, or a dinner at the newest pop-up? No one tells stories about the nights they went home to bed - so do something exciting this week!\n\nSometimes spontaneity can be rewarding.\n\n[![18865910](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/18865910.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/18865910.jpg)",

I used to go to them quite a lot when I was younger, either seeing screaming rock bands or booking tickets for festivals. Nowadays I just don't seem to think about looking to see who's playing. I only found out that the Parov Stelar Band was coming to Brixton by chance at work. I'd just got into electro swing so once I heard I had no excuse not to book it. [![IMG_1790](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_1790-768x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_1790.jpg) After a cheeky pub dinner we headed into the Brixton O2 arena. Unfortunately we missed the support band The Rochelle (cloak room queues!) but Parov Stelar more than made up for it. You can't beat that buzz that spreads through the room as the band begins to take the stage. We were up dancing and bouncing around the crowd to the music. It was incredible. They played all of my favourite songs including Catgroove, Josephine, Clap your hands, and All night. The encore was a crazy mix of Golden Boy, Libella Swing and Matilda. There was even a moment when, before the tune dropped, the entire Brixton Academy stood still waiting to jump. ![IMG_1806](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_1806-1024x768.jpg) The night ended far too soon for my liking and we were all on a high. I'd forgotten what it was like to stand in front of a band that can't wipe a smile off your face. The whole experience seems like a dream now but one I'd love to repeat. I don't know anyone who I've played Parov Stelar to that doesn't like it. The type of music seems perfect for my wedding; I'd love to have a similar band - I think it's time to start searching!",

He's doing it all for fun but at the end of the month I'm always quite shocked with how much he manages to raise without shouting about it too much. This year he and his team got £300. [Movember](http://uk.movember.com/) raises awareness and money for testicular cancer. This is all helped by a final push with their gala parties. We went along to one two years ago and didn't really know what to expect. At that time I was working in John Lewis so rushed to get there after my shift. I met Charlie, Rob & Silvia and we all dressed as cowboys. The aim was to dress to suit your mo and wow, some people really went for it! I couldn't believe how good some of the outfits and Mos were. We met a gynaecologist who was a movember rep that had been growing his moustache and it was **giant**! ![469084_10152475888995001_1371573114_o](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/469084_10152475888995001_1371573114_o-1024x768.jpg)\n\n_With the Gynaecologist and two doctors!_\n\nThe venue was at Billingsgate market and as we walked in, a brass band snaked across the room before leading us through curtains up to the stage. There were giant disco balls, dancers and the feeling that anything could happen on that night. [![469009_10152475889760001_1296013493_o](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/469009_10152475889760001_1296013493_o-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/469009_10152475889760001_1296013493_o.jpg)   It's no surprise that when this year came around we were really excited to get tickets. Although the venue wasn't as fun (this time in a sports hall in Bethnal Green), the Movember team had gone all out - and so did we. Taking tips from our first year, Charlie and I dressed up as Tonto and Lady Harrington (ish) from The Lone Ranger. Charlie even went as far as putting a dead partridge on his head - sorry in advance!\n\n[![P1030857](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1030857-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1030857.jpg)\n\nDuring the gala there are various prizes up for grabs such as lamest Mo, Mo of Movember, best Mo bro and Mo sister, best team and best Mo sister. It's no surprise that we were nominated for best Mo bro and Mo sister and got through to the final. Sadly our winning streak ended there after a somewhat embarrassing dance off. Oh well, the rest of the night was amazing and lots of people said they wanted us to win!\n\n[![P1030860](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1030860-768x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/P1030860.jpg)\n\n_We don't look too happy with our nominations! _\n\nEven though I've only been twice, each Movember gala is one of the highlights of my November. It's such a different night to others in the year and is the perfect excuse to pull together a fancy dress outfit and go all out (honestly, anything goes). Until next year Movember!",

I think Charlie's grandparents bought this for him for christmas one year but it's really handy to have. Whenever I'm bored of the normal things I make I reach for this. It has pretty standard food but each one is slightly more exciting. We've made quite a few bits out of the book so far. There's a recipe with 100 cloves of garlic that I really want to try out. ![IMG_5292](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_5292-1024x682.jpg) This time though, we had made green beans to go with smoked gammon and roast potatoes - it was perfect. They would also go really well with chicken breast or even as a meal by themselves. **Green beans with tapenade, tomatoes and garlic**\n\n*   Cut the ends off the green beans and slice them slightly (just to make it look interesting)\n*   Boil them in salted water until they're tender and drain\n*   Sprinkle a little olive oil and 2 teaspoons of tapenade and lay on a plate\n*   Fry off some roughly chopped garlic and leave to one side (for the top layer)\n*   Chop tomatoes and fry them in olive oil (I also threw in some pine nuts at this point but this isn't on the recipe)\n*   Season with salt and pepper and 2 teaspoons of tapenade\n*   Scatter this on top of the green beans\n*   Finish by throwing the garlic on top\n\n  [![IMG_5288](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_5288-682x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_5288.jpg) Yummy! We didn't know what tapenade was and there didn't seem to be any in the shops so I made some myself. It was really easy and surprisingly tasty. We now have a whole jar of it in the fridge for next time too!

      "wordpressContent": "Excitement begins to build up throughout December time as the lights get turned on, trees get decorated and the Christmas jumpers appear. I love Christmas time. It's a great excuse to switch off your everyday life and spend time with your family.We have a set routine on Christmas morning: wake up, have breakfast, line up in age order and enter the lounge for present time! I love surprises so the moment when I get to give people their presents and see their reactions is always fun. Since going to a talk on [Suffocation](http://vikibell.com/creativity/ \"Creativity\") last year I've been asking myself more and more the reason behind the gifts.\n\nI've noticed that there is increasingly less reason to buy a physical object for someone. No longer do you need a walkman, CDs, DVDs, camera, notepad or map - you have a phone. Yet every year for Christmas people find themselves trailing around the shops looking for gifts to package up. This is where gift guides can sometimes be useful. But are they doing more harm than good? When I've been really stuck I've glanced across at gift guides and felt like they are just an easy way out. I found myself trying to fit the person to the gift rather than the other way around. Each person is different and the stereotypical 18-25 year old male gift won't suit both my brother and Fiancé. This year I've decided to think of it differently so I thought I'd share my present planning techniques...\n\n*   What do they like to **do** - is there anything that relates?\n    *   Hobbies - do they need new equipment?\n    *   Clubs - a new book for book club?\n    *   Drinking - a cocktail book?\n*   What **age** are they at - will they begin doing something new?\n    *   University - something nice for their new room?\n    *   Driving - a guide to driving? New mix tape?\n    *   New job - a desk ornament?\n    *   New children - photo frames?\n*   Have they **been anywhere** interesting lately?\n    *   Maybe you could get them a T-shirt from a gig they went to?\n    *   Print photos from a holiday?\n*   Have they not been anywhere interesting lately?\n    *   Treat them to **something different** to their every day life?\n        *   Spa\n        *   Comedy night\n        *   A tasting\n        *   A new class\n*   What do you enjoy **doing** together?\n    *   Try something new together?\n*   **Where** do they work?\n    *   Do they need something special to help them with their job?\n    *   Could you get them something funny to do with it?\n*   What makes them **laugh**?\n    *   If you can't think of something to get them can you at least **make them laugh** on Christmas day?\n        *   This is where silly hats come in!\n*   Is there anything you can add to the day?\n    *   Maybe some wine for your Christmas lunch?\n*   What can you make?\n    *   People always appreciate the **thought and effort** that goes into something you create\n        *   You don't have to be an artist to create something beautiful it's all in the story behind it\n\nFinally, **positive memories** are always amazing to get as a gift. Be that a photo of that time or a chance to relive it through something similar it will always be appreciated. This is my take on buying gifts. It gives me a good insight into the person and what I imagine they will like. Hope it helps with your Christmas shopping too!

I've introduced Suffolk in a previous [post](http://vikibell.com/suffolk/ \"Suffolk\") but be prepared to hear more about it...\n\n[![IMG_5360](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5360-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5360.jpg)\n\nWe'd booked to meet a wedding caterer on Saturday morning near Bury St Edmunds so we were up early and on the road from Southend. We really got on well with the caterers and had nothing but praise for them. I'm really hoping that we've found the right person for us but lets wait until the tasting to decide for sure. As the frost started to lift and the day begun, we headed straight for the Cottage to light the fires and plan our day. I always find going away for a weekend difficult as I try to make the most out of every moment and seem to forget that I'm there to relax! So it's no surprise that we ended up walking into Aldeburgh, which took an hour, and walking back via dinner in The Dolphin.\n\n[![Suffolk](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5354-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5354.jpg)\n\n[![Suffolk](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5372-1024x682.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5354.jpg)\n\nWhilst in Aldeburgh we did a bit of Christmas shopping and had a cheeky drink at The Cross Keys. There's nothing like sitting by a warm fire having a drink during the winter. Of course I chose Aspalls as it's local, the same reason Charlie had an Adnams.\n\n![Suffolk](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5388-1024x682.jpg)\n\nAs we walked to the Dolphin for dinner we were amazed by the reflection of the moon on the sea. Of course I whipped out my camera and tried to capture it but the photos don't really show how bright it was. The shadows we cast were as defined as the ones we get with sunlight - it was crazy how bright it was. I think I'm too used to the light pollution of London! [![Suffolk](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5401-682x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5401.jpg) [![Suffolk](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5413-1024x753.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_5413.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "There's something almost magical about Camden Market on the run up to Christmas. I always find myself visiting at this time of year searching around for some unusual gifts.  I'd planned out my Christmas presents, using my [gift guide](http://vikibell.com/my-guide-to-gifts/ \"My guide to gifts\") of course, and set off bright an early. Unfortunately I was forgetting that Camden doesn't really wake up until lunch time. This gave me a chance to have a look round as the stalls were getting set up. I don't think I'd been to a market whilst it was setting up before but it was really interesting to see the routines the stall owners had. They all knew each other and were chatting and laughing together. Some were even singing and dancing along to the radio. Overall I got the feeling that they loved what they were doing and were really looking forward to the day. I wrote this post in the corner of Ruby Duck, a small coffee place in the heart of one of the markets. A bunch of people came in and I could hear all their excitement over their gift ideas. One lady had bought a present and was obviously over joyed with it. As I've mentioned before, I don't see much point of a gift unless your excited to give it. Countless times this Christmas I've had easy options for gifts suggested to me such as CDs or clothing but I've opted out for more of a challenge. What I've bought it still top secret but lets just say that I've thought outside the box and I'm really excited to give everyone their gifts. I'd really recommend visiting Camden Market during a week day. The crowds can get a bit much of a weekend, especially during school holidays. There's all sorts to discover around the stalls but I personally love the choice of jewellery on offer. There's a great stand that sells crystals and stones from around the world in the top of the Market Hall called [Jewellery of the Earth](http://www.camdenlockmarket.com/shops/stalls/jewellery-of-the-earth/) - the stall owner is really lovely too and full of great advice.   [![coffee](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/coffee-768x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/coffee.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "![panarama](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/panarama-1024x243.jpg) Family walks are always a thing over Christmas, wether thats because you're over stuffed with turkey and other goodies or due to the vast amount of alcohol consumed during the run up to Christmas. Whatever your reason it's a good excuse to get outside and see the frost on the ground and feel the chill in the air. Usually I go on a big Boxing day walk with Charlie's family and friends. We all head towards Hadleigh castle and and go in a big loop back across the sea wall. Of course there's a pause in the middle for mulled wine and minced pies! After skipping the walk this year (we were sleeping!) I was keen to get outside. ![IMG_2240](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2240-768x1024.jpg) My dad is training to do a [big walk](https://bellyswalk.wordpress.com/) in the Sahara at March so has been forcing himself on three/four/five hour walks over the holidays and this was my chance to go with him. I pieced together some sort of walking kit from my brother's jacket, mum's shoes, dad's scarf and Charlie's hat - very prepared I know, and we set off at the crack of dawn. You can see our route below - I only downloaded the app a quarter of the way into the walk! There should actually be a line joining up the route making it about 11/12 miles. [![IMG_2298](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2298-576x1024.png)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2298.png) The best thing about walking in the morning is that you get to see the sun come up and everything seems to come to life. We didn't see any other people until nearly the end of the walk which was when we were in a more popular forest. [![IMG_2213](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2213-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2213.jpg) I think I was most excited to see goats - I didn't know there was goats just roaming around a field in Brentwood! There was also some sheep, a horse and plenty of squirrels to be seen too. [![IMG_2229](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2229-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2229.jpg) This is the top of Jury Hill which has amazing views. Apparently you can see the Shard from it sometimes. I could just about make out the M25 and A127 through the mist but the view was great. I took the photos on my phone as I didn't want to carry my SLR - I had to be quick though else the Nike running app would tell me off for pausing! [![IMG_2275](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2275-768x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2275.jpg) I real enjoyed the walk and want to make sure I spare some time in the new year to go on others. My last walk was an 8 eight round trip to the pub for lunch, in Dunwich, last January! Have you been on a walk this Christmas?",

      "wordpressContent": "Now Christmas and New Year has passed I plan to get cracking on the wedding planning. There's plenty to do before July and the more I do now the longer I have to sit back and enjoy the run up to the day. What's caught my interest is the traditions and how they have changed over the years, the main one obviously being the lack of people getting married in a church. For my own reasons I've chosen to skip the church part and have opted for a civil ceremony in a beautiful country home - [Glemham Hall](http://www.glemhamhall.co.uk/). The grounds and the house itself are beautiful, it's a typical old country home thats got character and history behind it. The reason the house means so much to Charlie and I is that it's something we always recall when we are driving up to the Cottage. It's the place that means we're almost there and the last landmark I remember when we drive home. Of course since we've booked it every time we drive past we wave like a pair of lunatics! I've set this weekend aside for designing the invitations. Seeing as both Charlie and I have an art/ design background I don't see why we shouldn't be doing these ourselves. Not only does it give the personalised touch but it means we can have them exactly how we want them. Well, just as soon as we work out how we want them! I started off with a quick Google around invitations and then a read up of a few wedding blogs. [Rock My Wedding](http://www.rockmywedding.co.uk/) had a great [article](http://www.rockmywedding.co.uk/is-traditional-wedding-stationery-outdated/) about the use of stationery and whether it's become outdated. Seeing as Charlie and I are planning to setup a website as a blog/ place to get information about the wedding, I thought this was particularly interesting. As we move forward in our digital age where do we draw the line at being paperless? When I was at uni I loved getting post. Nan and Grandad would send me a postcard from each country they went to (you can image how many I got if they were on a cruise!) and my little cousins would send me drawings. With an event as big and important as a wedding you would expect a paper invite through the post - right? Well according to Rock My Wedding there's a fair amount of people who are now sending out their invitations via email in infographic style images. As we move away from paper I can see this trend taking off, not only is it cheaper, it's easier to collate all the RSVPs and keep a digital record of the invitees' data for any future events. Saying this, I don't see it being an option for us, I just can't move away from how excited I get when I get an invitation through the post and I want to allow my guests to have this too. An email invitation just doesn't compare, you haven't spent the time to get it printed, folded, written the address, stamped the envelope, post it etc. and when you get 100s of emails a day what's special about another one inviting you to something?

      "wordpressContent": "So this post maybe unleashing my inner geek to some of you but it doesn't even scratch the surface of what's going on tech wise.\n\nBlack mirror fans may have seen the episode where the characters had chips in their eyes and could record everything they see. There was also the episode recently with a clone in another reality. Well, all of this could be closer than we think. A few years ago Charlie mentioned that we may one day all be plugged into machines living in fictional world. We would have no need to move as we'd get all our nutrients from the machines - sort of like The Matrix. Of course this pretty much terrified me, what if we were living this now only we didn't know? What if I'd chosen to play out this game of life which feels like ages and when I die I'm given options of other games to play, maybe I'd like to be a dragon or a prince? Charlie also mentioned that the futurologists were predicting that in our lifetime we would have infinity life so we shall have to wait and see if that part comes true.\n\nWe've been so scared of living in a big brother world that most people are now in denial. After going to a talk this week around technology, I realise that it's a lot further on than most people know. We can predict what's happening but there is so much data around right now that we can find out pretty much anything. Think about it - you have your phone with you 24/7, that phone has GPS, knows all your information though Facebook, Twitter etc and that phone can tell advertisers where you will be using predictions of your monthly/ weekly routines. It will know that I get the Victoria line to work as I get internet on the underground but this knowledge will eventually allow my phone to message me to show me delays, flash sales/ discounts nearby, and people around me during my route. Think about it in terms of the O2 priority app that tells you deals that day near you, whats to stop that then messaging you to let you know your favourite burrito shop is handing out free burritos? The data gathered by using that app allows O2 to gain a profile of you around your eating/ shopping/ entertainment habits so can market to you better, perhaps with personalised phone contracts and deals.\n\nWe've got Philips hue lightbulbs in our flat and have named each one by which room it's it. Things like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) (if this then that) can allow us to make theses bulbs smarter and connected to other products. We already have an app which means we can control them remotely - so I could turn them on as I leave work so the house is light when I get back. But we could easily use IFTTT to make them smarter and start picking up our habits so they would know to turn the lights on as we got near home for example. It could easily tie in with our phone GPS to see where each of us are and make sure our house looks like it's occupied at all times. It could even connect to a smart lock like [Lockatron](https://lockitron.com/) so that you could allow a visitor into the house and turn on the lights for them all remotely.\n\nThe smarter these devices get the more opportunity there is for brands to market themselves. There's no reason why the data our lights pick up couldn't link to our ovens so they could preheat of us or suggest meals we could make by learning the usual times we like to eat and how long we have to prepare them by this time. They could become security devices and change around whilst we are away, flash when someone is at the door or we get a call, or change colour to reflect our moods by judging us on our social posts.\n\n![IMG_1748](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_1748-768x1024.jpg)\n\nThere are plenty of interesting projects out thee cropping up all the time. Places like Kickstarter and Indigogo have a whole array of interesting projects. We got these the other week from [Mipow](http://www.playbulb.com/en/playbulb-candle-bluetooth-smart-led-flameless-candle.html) and they're LED candles. All you need to do is tap them on the table or blow them out to turn them on and off. Just a quirky little gimmick to liven up dinnertime!\n\nAs with most things in life the opportunities for tech are endless you just need to know what there is out there and how to use it.",

      "wordpressContent": "I went swimming after work earlier this week. It was my first swim of 2015 and it's inspired me to get back into a swimming routine. It seemed to be the perfect thing to get rid of my January blues except for the fact I couldn't stop. After completing my usual routine I kept on swimming until I realised I'd done 120 lengths, my eyes were bloodshot from having no goggles and my legs were like jelly! As I swam I thought about the unspoken rules of the swimming pool, I've listed them below for you keen fish out there...\n\n*   Don't just stand and chat at the bottom of the lanes, either move to a more open section or get swimming\n*   If you're resting at the end of the pool, make sure you keep out the way of swimmers\n*   Switch lanes if your going to go slower. No one likes to be stuck behind someone when they have a routine to do\n*   If you are in the right lane but doing a slower stroke, let the person going fast go ahead of you at the end of your length\n*   Don't overtake unless you have the space - I watched two swimmers bash into each other because one was trying to overtake a slower swimmer\n*   Don't zig zag down the lane, stick to your side and swim straight\n*   Don't make eye contact with lifeguards. It's either looks like your drowning or trying to chat them up (or both)\n*   Speaking of which don't make eye contact with anyone in the changing room ESPECIALLY when 80% of them are wondering around naked\n*   If you do insist on getting completely starkers in the changing rooms try to keep it to a minimum or in one place\n*   Butterfly - no you can't do it and no matter how hard you try you look like a drowning seal. Not even worth attempting\n*   And finally don't pee in the pool!\n\n[![P1060065](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/P1060065-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/P1060065.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Being ginger is always a little difficult unless you fully embrace it. Think about it - how many true gingers do you see each day? I bet most people can think of one redhead they know straight away, their token ginger friend. When I was at school I used to get vaguely bullied for being ginger - nothing too harsh just negative comments about my hair colour making me feel like I was ugly. It was only when I got older and turned into the slightly crazier version of me that I fully embraced it. This was about the time I was walking around with black streaks through my hair and styling it similarly to Russell Brand; someone even tried to insult me by calling me his name once. ![ginger](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SSL21520-e1422819705373-242x300.jpg) Since that day I've had plenty of colours through my hair: pink, orange, purple, blue, blonde and black, but I've always refused to fully dye it and loose my 'orange glow'. Unfortunately though this in inevitable, as I get older my hair gets darker so now I have to face comments telling me I'm not ginger anymore. Brands even skim over the redheads. I spotted an email recently from Wahanda which was encouraging you to dye your hair brown or blonde. What about ginger? I know we're only a small percent of the population but thousands of people dye their hair red - why wouldn't you include that in your newsletter? ![ginger](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SAM_1194-1024x683.jpg) I think it can be a struggle for kids growing up with red hair, they always stand out and always look different which is prime material for bullying. I personally love the look of ginger hair, whether that's ginger, auburn, red or whatever shade you have. It's something different that you should be proud of. And so here's a photo of 15 year old me, around the stage I started appreciating my hair, ignoring all the ginger hatred. ![Ginger](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SSL21442-225x300.jpg)",

I made it a few times last year and noticed that I'd managed to stock up on all the ingredients before Christmas but never made any. On a dull Sunday it seemed like the perfect thing to do. I tend to make up the amounts of ingredients as I go so feel free to add in more or less of something. The recipe was originally given to me by India. ![IMG_2472.JPG](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2472-768x1024.jpg)\n\n*   Take 2 big bars of milk chocolate and melt over simmering water with a lump of butter and 3 spoonfuls of honey - you can also add extra sugar if you fancy but that really isn't necessary!\n*   You can substitute the chocolate bars for any others you have in the house like mars bars, toffee crisp etc. but be careful as the consistency of the melted chocolate will change. I've used easter eggs and chocolates from a tin of celebrations before so experiment!\n*   While the chocolate is melting smash up some digestives\n*   Use about half a large pack of marshmallows and add half of them into the chocolate once it melts, mix in the rest of them with the biscuits. This will make some of them more gooey than others\n*   Once you've done this pour the melted chocolate over the biscuits and mix it all together\n*   Put a sheet of baking paper over a dish (this helps cleaning later) and pour the mixture over. You want it to be about 10cm thick so make sure it doesn't spread out too much\n*   For the melted marshmallows on top just add some more from the pack and pop this on a low heat in the over for about 10 minutes\n*   After this time use a palette knife to smudge them on top\n*   Then take the whole mixture and let it cool on the side over night OR pop it in the fridge for a few hours\n*   Cut it into little portions and enjoy the sugar rush!\n\n![IMG_2475.JPG](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2475-e1422808310382-1024x868.jpg)",

Before I describe our dinner I need to point out that as soon as we sat down I got my first visual migraine so the evening was slightly tainted. ![IMG_2525.JPG](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2525-1024x1024.jpg) We were given bread and olives as we ordered which was lovely. We usually ask for balsamic vinegar with it but it was so fresh we didn't want to take away the taste. The mussels we chose to start with were by far the highlight of the meal. It was either the fact that we hadn't had them for ages or their freshness but they were really tasty. ![IMG_2533.JPG](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2533-768x1024.jpg) The main course was a bit of a let down as we'd expected it to be amazing after the previous food. We'd ordered steak with bernaise sauce and chicken in a mushroom sauce. The plan was, as usual, to split both and share the sides. The chicken was well cooked but both pieces of meat just tasted very standard and cheap. The meal would have been okay if I'd been better company! I'd had migraines before but never anything visual. I could see all these lines across my vision but had no headache at all. By the time the main course came I was finding it really difficult to remember the easiest words. I kept trying to mime them out - it's safe to say I'm pretty bad at charades. We must have looked hilarious to everyone else in the restaurant. By the time we left I'd got my sight back but from then until afternoon the next day everything's quite a blur. Not something I want to repeat in a hurry!   Maybe we'll attempt to go out for dinner again soon...",

Last year we went along to this giant tipi on the roof and a big open fire where they made various burgers like wild boar. After we ate paper and pens were handed out. Puzzled, we took some and waited for our instructions. It turned out we were to play that game, you know that game, the one where you turn the paper draw something and pass it along to the next person that draw something else. Anyway we all spent the evening drawing very peculiar looking monsters.

Tenerife wasn't the tourist destination it is today. In fact our complex was next to a banana plantation, now it's in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Las Americas and Costa Adeje! Tenerife has always been special to me, I came here at less than a year old. It's where I learnt to swim, my first beach holiday and where I made my first holiday friends. The apartment is the perfect (and cheap!) holiday for anyone looking to get away from the dull skies of England and top up on their vitamin D. ![996110_10155287561825621_2967861965285434618_n](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/996110_10155287561825621_2967861965285434618_n-e1426532789883.jpg) I've got so many stories of my time here as a kid, as I've probably bored India of during our week! These has been added to through my four trips here since being a 'grownup'. I've been here with Charlie, friends and now India. If you're considering coming to Tenerife for a holiday one of my recommendations would be the trip up to Mount Tiede - I went on my first visit with Charlie and it's amazing to see the island mapped out below you and hear the history through some fantastic guides.

It may just be me having an _I love London_ moment but have you taken the time recently to look at your surroundings and really appreciate the beauty and history of it all?\n\n<div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392);\">![IMG_3760.JPG](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3760-768x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392);\">Last night I decided to walk an extra station before getting the tube home. Once I started I couldn't stop and ended up walking the hour and a half to home. My walk took me from Victoria through Green Park, across Mayfair and through Camden.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392);\">It was a sunny evening and I just kept day dreaming and listening out to the various sounds I could hear. I love the little snippets of history that you hear about these places from passing strangers. One was saying about the previous owners of a building and what it had been used for years ago; another mentioned an accident that happened with a window pane. I'd love to know more facts about the areas I live in and be able to tell others how a building has changed hands over the years or what happened on certain streets.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392);\"><span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">Everywhere looked glorious through the low shining sun and I kept pausing to take photos. I love that I can take the time out to have a walk across London, it's so much nicer than getting on a sweaty packed tube! Im going to aim to walk home more often during the summer. It doesn't take long out of your day and you feel really good afterwards. It certainly feels a lot better than coming straight back to watch Netflix! </span></div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392);\"> [![IMG_3764.JPG](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3764-1024x857.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3764.jpg)</div>\n\n</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">After hearing a lot about the comedy venue, [The Miller](http://www.themiller.co.uk/), we decided to head down there on Friday night. From the website it looks like it offers a lot and has quite a few nights on from comedy to gigs.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">They have a fantastic choice in craft beers and ciders and their food menu was super tempting with its pulled pork burger and chilli fries. Drinks in hand we headed upstairs. Every Friday Hoopla Improv put on a night where various acts perform, at the end they open up the stage for the audience to take a turn. We were greeted with party rings and hats, we didn't realise it was one of their acts, Music Box's 5th birthday!</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">[![IMG_3826](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3826-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3826.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">The nights theme was musical improv and, after we'd warmed up, the first act begun. I'd never watched improv before and it was hard to believe they were making it up in the spot, especially when they just burst into song. The act lasted the whole of the first half but was broken up into a number of sketches. The trick with improv (or so I'm told) is to know when to end the sketch.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">The second act saw three girls perform and I was amazed at how simple they made it look to slip into different characters. The third act of the night was Music Box. They usually perform with a couple of them on the stage but they decided that for their big night they'd do it with all 14 of them - interesting! Improv always calls for the audience to name a situation, the first we had was _Hell in Basildon_ (!!) which ended up as a love story.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">[![IMG_3850](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3850-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3850.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">Each sketch lasted about 5-10 minutes which was just enough time for a plot to develop. I think my favourite part was when someone asked for a sword and a woman jumped out waving her arms stating that she was indeed a flaming sword. She then had to stand with her arms in the air for the rest of the act - the point that she looked nothing like a sword was just ridiculous funny.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">[![IMG_3852](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3852-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3852.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">After the final sketch we had another drinks break and then it was time for the audience to take a turn. Names were picked at random from a list at the back so you had no idea who you were working with. From the feel of it a lot of people in the improv scene go along to these nights for a chance to be involved and see others perform - which is why we were there. Since January Charlie had been going to a class each week and was now on his 'level two' so wanted to see what the social scene was like. With a little encouragement he signed himself up. At first he wasn't sure about the musical part as that's something he hadn't done before but if you don't try it you don't know.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">[![IMG_3885](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3885-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3885.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">Turns out he's funny! The theme for his sketch was meeting in a toilet so obviously it got a bit weird but then it turned out that Charlie was a poltergeist who was haunting the place. I thought the four of them worked really well together as they were each there to make the others better. I really enjoyed my first experience of improv and thought the Miller was a great venue for it. Everyone was really friendly and in such a good mood for a laugh. If you find yourself around London Bridge on a Friday or Saturday night make sure you pop in.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">![IMG_3907](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3907-1024x1024.jpg)</div>",

We love really bright colours but want to make sure our decoration looks slightly more mature than our old place (bead curtains and photos covering walls is only a good look for students).

If steaks on the menu it's always my go to dish. I'm quite often a bit disappointed by it though as we've perfected our cooking time so much that often a restaurant just doesn't compare. Here was different. I had the fillet and Charlie had fillet on the bone. They were both amazing. Perfectly cooked (and still mooing). This was paired with the red wine that was recommended by the sommelier. It wasn't a red that I would choose normally but it went really well with the meat.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"> [![IMG_7336](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7336-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7336.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">We're not very desserty people so decided to skip that and had after dinner drinks instead.

We moved here two years ago not knowing the area but I've really grown to love it. There's a really now community feel around and we've recently got a really great butchers, fishmongers and soon to be a bakery.  I love popping into the local grocery shop for our Sunday lunches.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"> [![IMG_0353](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0353-1024x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0353.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">One weekend when we first moved here we took ourselves on a tour of all the parks. We started with the playing fields of Tufnell Park and ventured round to Highgate cemetery and Dartmouth park. There's plenty of green spaces nearby if you just want to get out in the fresh air. Tufnell Park proves especially useful last summer when Charlie decided to teach me how to play tennis. It was perfect to book on a Saturday morning and force yourself out of bed! And of course I can't leave out Hampstead Heath. I can't count the amount of hours we've spent walking around there, playing board games or having picnics.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">My two favourite places to eat in Tufnell Park are definitely Aces and Eights and the Junction. Both are very different. We're still convinced that the pizzas in [Aces and Eights](http://www.acesandeightssaloonbar.com/) are the best we've ever had. The bar changed hands a while ago and is become a little more mainstream, it's lost the dark and dingy feel it originally had with the pinup girls posters scattered around the room but it's still a great place to visit. [The Junction](http://www.junctiontavern.co.uk/) is very different. A gastro pub that we always overspend and over eat at! Their menu changes regularly but they've always got foods that are in season. We went a few nights ago and their scallops were incredible. The waiter told us they were fresh in that day and had only just come onto the menu. All the waiters there are lovely and will always advise you on what to have as well.</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"> [![IMG_2995](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_2995-e1431869754888-768x1024.jpg)![IMG_3664](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3664-e1431869787353-768x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_2995.jpg)</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.301961); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(130, 98, 83, 0.0980392); text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\">Our love of North London has grown a lot and we won't be living far at all so at least we can come back and visit!

      "wordpressContent": "An long weekend in Suffolk was just the excuse to have a play around with my camera. I've always had an interest in photography but have never really learn the tips and tricks of it. I took a photography module at uni but it was more the lecturer showing you his work then encouraging you to take one photo that was similar. All a bit too regimented for me. I've been playing around with my DLSR a lot more at the moment, flicking the aperture around and trying to work out all the ISO settings. I really like putting it onto manual focus and focusing on something in a strange area of the photo. I'm always amazed by what the camera can pull out and how it can completely change the scene that you're looking at. On our first day we went into Aldeburgh. The weather was insane. It was so grey and misty you could hardly see a thing. I love the beach there; it always has the fishing boats just tied up with all of their netting and stuff around. I'm not sure if they're still used or just sit there. The netting looks like cobwebs on the ground. ![Aldeburgh](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3505-e1431880646284-768x1024.jpg \"Aldeburgh\") As we headed home I saw the wild horses in the field so I borrowed Sarah's higher aperture lens and went for a walk down the track. I was stood for about half an hour still against a post with my hood up trying my best to channel my inner horse so they'd come closer. It worked! The lens also helped as it has such a wide aperture (?) I think the brown horse got a bit territorial of me as he came over and kept giving me a mean look. Once he decided that I was harmless he walked away and let the white horse come closer. ![Horse](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7137-1024x683.jpg \"Horse\") ![Horse](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7145-1024x683.jpg \"Horse\") ![Horse](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7129-1024x683.jpg \"Horse\") Sarah's lens was also the reason we were able to get these next photos. I went outside after dinner and the moon was crazy bright. The difference in lighting compared with London is insane - it sounds really silly to say but when you're so used to the light pollution a completely black night is amazing. Anyway, on that night there was a fully moon and fully moons in Suffolk means light so bright it gives you shadows. With a tiny bit of help from next doors outside lighting we were able to capture these beauties! [![Charlie and I](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7305-1024x683.jpg \"Charlie and I\")](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7305.jpg)![Us](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_7257-683x1024.jpg \"us\") Kitty came to sit with me as Charlie and I were lying outside the next day. She's always so scared of everyone but every so often she will come over and say hey! ![Cat](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3527-e1431881848471-747x1024.jpg \"Cat\") The final night saw us set fire to a neighbours old Christmas tree. We usually build pretty big fires in Suffolk and roast marshmallows but it was all a bit too damp so we had a vaguely burning failing attempt at a fire going on. Eventually, after countless attempts at setting different bits of it alight, it burn through the tree. I was happy enough as I love building fires. At one point I was even standing in the middle of it - that either says something about my immaturity or something about the fire. ![Tree](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3552-e1431881873465-768x1024.jpg \"Tree\")[![IMG_3573](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3573-e1431883268528-768x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3573.jpg) On the last morning we went on a walk through the fields and came across some piggies. I have a feeling this one's a bit of a joker! ![Pigs](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_3579-1024x768.jpg \"Pigs\")",

      "wordpressContent": "<span style=\"line-height: 24px;\">When I first got engaged everyone was telling me how quickly it would creep up on us and how much I had to do. Of course I didn't believe them and thought if anyone could do it Charlie and I could. I wasn't so far wrong but what I've found is that it would all be very simple to plan if it wasn't for everyone else.</span> Here are my 12 tips for wedding planning:\n\n1.  Everyone will always ask you if you're looking forward to it even though it's months away. Politely nod and give them the same answer you gave them last week.\n2.  Everyone will give input into your ideas and have their own way of doing things. Let them have their say but remember it's your day and you and your partner are the two most important and special people there. The most important thing is that you are together and happy.\n3.  Tiny tasks will take the longest. I thought doing a gift list would be simple but after walking aimlessly around John Lewis for hours we gave up and decided to pull our own one together - weeks later we're still doing it!\n4.  Have a gift list - people generally want to buy you a special present for your day. I thought it sounded silly to ask people to buy you things but if you don't you'll end up with lots of the same thing - champagne. Okay, okay not the biggest problem in the world but storing it all in a tiny flat is!\n5.  No matter how excited you are about that thing you planned you don't need to tell everyone. Yes, it's your day, and yes, it will be amazing but people won't care if you've finally found the perfect centrepiece or invitation design.\n6.  Think outside the box. You don't have to do everything by the book, if you fancy skipping the fancy cars go for it, if you don't want a cake there's no need for one.\n7.  <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Pinterest is not your friend. You'll end up creating all these magical boards about a cool wedding but it just isn't possible unless you both quit your jobs and work full time on wedding prep. We wanted to create and make so much stuff but in between working and socialising (and moving house) we simply haven't had the time. </span>\n8.  <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Decisions aren't life threatening - well most of them aren't. If in doubt toss a coin.</span>\n9.  Delegate<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> - people closest to you want to be involved in the prep so accept a little help. We gave Charlie's mum the task of organising transport - not the most entertaining task in the world but she knows the area best and it's one thing off our mind. </span>\n10.  <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Be surprised. Weddings bring out strange things in people. I've heard plenty of objections to us not having a religious ceremony from people I didn't even know who were religious. </span>\n11.  <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Have a strict plus one policy. It's all or nothing. Simple. Be prepared for people to ask or assume (don't even go there) but would you rather have their partner or one of your friends there? By the time you give everyone a plus one you've doubled your guests. Okay okay married couples are different but surely that means you should know their partner slightly if they are such a good friend right? </span>\n12.  <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Don't panic about time. Book days in your diaries to just do wedding things. This will make sure you don't take up any last minute plans instead. For us it's all too often happened that a weekend of planning instead ends with us waking up hungover and in need of pizza and movie time.</span>\n\nI want to thank everyone who has helped in every single tiny way to plan our wedding. From doing the big tasks to hearing us deliberate over tiny decisions to distracting a us when we need a break. Wedding planning doesn't have to be hard if you take it in manageable pieces, a bit like BBC bitesize used to tell you. **Most importantly enjoy it and make sure you have fun along the way** - just like we did with our last April fools!

      "wordpressContent": "Our wedding day was the best day ever. I know a lot of people must say that but for us it was more than true. The whole day was so totally us that we can't think of anything we'd change if we could. We hosted it in Shellpits - the cottages in Suffolk I keep going on about. Even though Charlie and I were both there the night before coordination from our bridesmaids and groomsmen meant that we didn't see each other - even if Charlie did shout messages to me at midnight and I ran out of the house with a towel over me in the morning. I'd decided that I wanted to start my pre- wedding rituals off with an early morning beach trip and so all the girls (and Tom) had a dip in the sea. I love swimming in the sea in Suffolk - it's always a bit cold but once you're in its super refreshing and gets you energised for the day. ![Beach](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6051.jpg) After a speedy breakfast we popped into Aldeburgh to get our hair done. This was a last minute decision but I'm so glad we did as the girls in [The Hair Shop](http://www.thehairshopaldeburgh.co.uk/) did an amazing job. Once back at the house India was in charge of makeup. I'd chosen her to do it as I don't wear a lot of makeup so didn't fancy having someone who doesn't know me do it and coat me in the stuff. It was so nice to just be sat in the kitchen chilling as it was done rather than be under pressure of hoping a stranger can do it as you imagine. ![Anna's Hair](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/448613b9615e74567eea8d09df732854-1024x1024.jpg) Our [photographer](http://www.dominicwhiten.co.uk/) and videographer were incredible. They both arrived as we were starting to get ready and made themselves at home. [Dominic](http://www.dominicwhiten.co.uk/) even ended up advising India about doing up the corset section of my dress! Getting ready with them there was so casual and I don't think any of us noticed them snapping away or taking a few moments on film. And I still apologise to them for bouncing around in my underwear - what can I say, I was excited! Time for the dresses .... Well pictures tell a thousand words so here we all are: ![Dresses](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6074.jpg) Our flowers were an easy choice - [Jane Packer](http://www.jane-packer.co.uk/). Charlie's family are really great friends with Gary who now owns the business after Jane passed away and it was her flowers I wanted to be holding on the day as they mean so much to us and Shellpits. Thank you again Gary, Louise and the rest of the JP team, they were beautiful. ![Bride flowers](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/16f0ae86d0892a7b382e4265b9c91ed7-1024x1024.jpg) ![Bridesmaid Flowers](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bad4a4a2af0689882c31985b6ba4593d-1024x1024.jpg) My car of choice to arrive at Glemham Hall for our ceremony was an Aston Martin driven by Alec, a family friend. Lucky for me he'd made us a wedding themed playlist! ![Aston Martin](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/d0eb1ea9a86ce04f816304e461b29708-1024x1024.jpg) The ceremony is indescribable. I've got so many flashes of moments in my head I really hope they stay there forever. We even managed to make everyone laugh as we turned around to glare at the guests during the part where they ask if anyone objects. I had also coordinated with our pianist to get a few Disney songs playing before I arrived - subtle! Our readings were fairly difficult to decide but we got there in the end and I'm really happy with our choices. We had Ellie read _A Lovely Love Story by Edward Monkton_ then my littlest cousin dan read _The Little Yellow Leaf by Carin Berger_ and finally Richard read _The Owl And The Pussycat by Edward Lear_. There may have been a few giggles when he read the line 'pussy oh pussy oh my love why a wonderful pussy you are'. We chose to write our own vows which I won't share but let's just say they were pretty special :) After signing the register we half skipped down the aisle to Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">and outside into the sunshine. </span>\n\n_[Read part two here.](https://vikibell.com/posts/wedding-part-ii)_\n\n![7f563986c9007a68ff27923d247cc71Wedding party](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/7f563986c9007a68ff27923d247cc719-1024x768.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Part two of my super mega awesome, best day ever, wedding. Tea and cake recommended for reading this one through....![Wedding sign](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0047-1-e1439979994521-1024x761.jpg)A surprise method of transport from Charlie's parents had to be one thing - a blue VW campervan. Charlie dreams of being able to get one and do it up - one day Charlie, one day. We rode back to Shellpits and our reception in it which gave us a moment by ourselves to compare our mornings and talk about the ceremony. Thankfully campervans don't go too fast so we had time to chill and take a few selfies. ![Selfie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0798-768x1024.jpg) We swapped into the land rover for the track part of this ride and I'm really glad we got to involve it somehow in our day as I love that car! The campervan driver was amazed that I just lifted up my skirts and jumped straight in the back - I'm not quite the delicate bride type. India was driving and Jub Jub was in the front too. It was hilarious rocking up in it. Especially to some of my family members who are fairly conservative when it comes to weddings. ![Land rover](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Capture.png) After the confetti moment we had champagne and a lovely speech from India who gave a bit of an introduction to Shellpits. It was so good to see such a mix of people floating around all talking together. This was precisely our thinking with the table plan. We split up friends and mixed them with the same kinds of age groups. Yes, I admit we did try to match make in some places - and were fairly successful as we found out the next day...! ![Confetti ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/18630fd94a55434676924f7f37292a43-1024x768.jpg) Dinner passed with a blur of speeches, good food and champagne. We tried to get around all the tables but it was impossible. Our special touch to the main course was that Charlie's grandma and grandpa had made all the mint jelly. They love coming up to Shellpits to make various jams and jellies so it was an obvious choice to share the yumminess with our guests. Dessert was a little different as well. It was half a pineapple filled with fresh fruit and accompanied with rocky road. ![Mint Jelly](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0187-731x1024.jpg) I was really nervous for the first dance. Only four people knew the song and I'm not such a great dancer - especially in a giant dress. This was our biggest surprise of the day and was guaranteed tears *cue evil laugh*. It was such an obvious choice and so was who played it. We love our friend Grant's voice and music so asked if he could play for us. Suspense built? I'll cut to what the song actually was... _You've Got A Friend In Me_ from _Toy Story_. Looking back I had no need to be nervous. We were pretty good - I think! I even managed a semi pro looking spin. ![First Dance](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6106.jpg) Our second dance was _Love Shack_ - yes Charlie did let me choose it. Everyone came running on and jumping around. I didn't exactly stick to the standard bridal swaying and instead preferred to jump around the dance floor. There was even a few low floor dance moves and some spinning of the skirt. At one point India and I spent a good few songs simply jumping up and down - a great workout if anyone's interested! Who knows what we must have looked like to the oldies who had pulled up chairs to watch us all. We were supposed to be organising fireworks as a surprise for Sarah and David but they had planned them as a surprise for us so we ended up having an extra special display. It was a great break after the first few energetic dances. I'd really recommended it around that point in the night, if not fireworks can seem like the end of an evening when in fact they were only the beginning! I also used the opportunity to toss my bouquet. Everyone gathered around any i can remember my aunts trying to fight it out to catch it. My bridesmaid, Ellie, never one to loos a game of catch, caught it. Her boyfriend was there and looked very excited. **UPDATE:** Richard proposed in late 2015 and they are getting married in August - our next wedding!! ![Catching the bouquet](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1060.2061-1024x683.jpg) A wedding isn't complete without a photo booth and in true Charlie and Viki style we'd decided to make our own. It seemed silly to spend money on hiring one when we have an excessively large selection of props. Instructions will be posted soon for anyone who wants to recreate it. It also means we now own one - for all your photo booth needs! I don't think I ever saw it not being used and some of the wigs even made it onto the dance floor. ![Photo booth](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_8303-1024x683.jpg) Dancing, champagne, smiles and laughing at a few people stumbling around was pretty much the rest of the night. I was on such a high from the day and seeing everyone celebrate with us. Everyone had told us that our wedding day would pass with a blur - for me it really didn't. I made sure to capture and savour each moment I had with everyone. It wasn't just the perfect day, it was the perfect planning for the day too. Even the few days before when we were painting and decorating it was all an incredible amount of fun. Thank you to everyone who helped to make our wedding day so special I hope it sticks with you forever. I wish we could do it every year. ![The Meare](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11717359_10152894832585493_2800677672607356489_o-1024x682.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "We've had the first draft of our wedding video through and have finally printed off a bunch of the official photos. Everything wedding related is getting nicely wrapped up. The only big thing we need to do is sort out thank you cards - which will take bloody ages! Quite a few people have asked for tips looking back at the wedding so here some are.\n\n1.  Record everything. The next morning Charlie and I wrote down all our stories and memories on his phone whilst they were fresh in our minds. I'm pretty sure we'll appreciate the hell out of that later on.\n2.  Have a next day - we had a hog roast in the local pub where we'd got engaged. It was our way of showing our side of Suffolk and sharing a section of our day with the owners who always host us so well. It was also a great way of seeing everyone and hearing all the stories from the evening. For the people leaving that morning we also went to the beach for a dip in the sea. Although cold it was super refreshing and managed to wash away the cobwebs. Rushing off on a honeymoon means you'll miss all the excitement the next day.![Next Day](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_0114-1024x768.jpg)\n3.  Encourage everyone to stay in the same place. It builds a bit more of an atmosphere for the guests not to mention helps with any transport!\n4.  Ask someone else to organise where you're staying that night. You've given so many people so many surprises during the day keep one for yourselves. India was in charge and we stayed in a cute little cottage down the road from the golf club where the majority of people stayed.\n5.  Don't be too strict with your plans. We never got around to thinking about a toast master so ended up asking on of the groomsmen to do it. We didn't know what time our first dance would be and if it would be before or after fireworks - we just went with whatever time fitted in with food.[![Fireworks](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1060.2081-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1060.2081.jpg)\n6.  Trust your suppliers. I really think we had awesome caterers and photographers and videographer and DJ. They were all as laid back as we were and happily sorted out things themselves. When we first met our photographer [Dominic](http://www.dominicwhiten.co.uk/) I felt as if we were all interviewing each other. He had to be right for us and us him. It worked amazingly. I can't speak highly enough of Dominic as he got stuck in and was able to help organise smaller aspects of our day which may have been overlooked. He was able to get all our guests sorted and captured the traditional shots with such speed there wasn't any hanging around. He even wrote a beautiful [post](http://www.dominicwhiten.co.uk/uncategorized/glemham-hall-thorpeness-wedding-photography-viki-charlie/) about the day. Together he and our caterer [Justin](http://www.themovablefeast.co.uk/) did incredibly. Justin even got involved in pulling up the reveal curtain for our first dance and greeted us with canapés as soon as we arrived. It small touches like that which confirm we made the correct decision with these guys.\n7.  Reveal curtain - have one. I thought people would know what it was but instead they wondered where the dance floor was. This made our first dance more of a surprise as people suddenly saw a whole new area of the marquee and rushed over to watch us.![Reveal Curtain ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1060.1961-1024x683.jpg)![First Dance](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1060.1955-1024x683.jpg)\n8.  Have a dress holding up contingency plan. Sounds strange and I'm not sure how to explain that but you'll appreciate it. Through vigorous jumping my bustle ended up breaking and I didn't want anyway standing on my already filthy train so I headed over to one of our more creative friends who ended up holding the whole thing up with ribbon and a tie through my bra strap. Difficult to get out of later on but a whole lot better than the whole thing tearing whilst dancing.\n9.  Stay as long as you like but leave before the Dj. We were worried that people wouldn't leave until we had but that was no problem as we had told everyone that the minibus we'd organised was doing trips from 10pm. It gave the oldies and excuse to leave if they wanted although most preferred to sit at the edge of the dance floor watching. With the DJ having about twenty minutes left we decided to have our last few songs and follow a people tunnel out to our transport. This helped wind down the night, we left on a high.\n10.  Don't have it in a venue. Now I imagine this make things a lot easier as to organise but they can also be strict with things like curfews etc. even if we weren't able to use the Shellpits field I would always think about renting a field or sports club land somewhere and put up a marquee. It gives you the freedom to do what you like.![Panoramic ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_0865-1024x236.jpg)\n11.  Have a honeymoon. Even if you just go away for a few days. We were debating having a small break after and a bigger holiday next year but decided to go all in and shot off to Bali two days after the wedding. I've appreciated the break a lot more than you can imagine and it's been so nice to spend time just Charlie and I exploring somewhere somewhere new.\n\n![Honeymoon](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9054-1-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "After the whole [blogger blackmail](http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2015/08/18/bloggerblackmail-why-both-bakery-and-blogger-were-wrong) moment I thought I'd get my thoughts down around working with bloggers and being a blogger. Before I start I want to say that although I count myself as a blogger it's all quite new to me still and, as you've probably noticed, I don't manage to get weekly posts out (or more!). I also work with bloggers on a variety of campaigns as part of my job so I feel like I can comment on both sides. These are my opinions and I've made them from working with bloggers and reading a hell of a lot of tweets, blogs and Facebook chats.\n\n# **The main issue**\n\nThe main problem in this this blogger/brand relationship is that brands are only just starting to recognise the potential of a blogger. By ignoring the roles bloggers play in brand awareness and marketing, brands are not allocating time, effort and money into their budgets to properly work with bloggers. They can't just expect to throw an \"oh and ping that release over to a few bloggers to cover it to would you?\" **_No. No. No_. _Not at all._** Bloggers are not journalists and can not be consistently chase for posts. More often than not bloggers are employed elsewhere and only started blogging as a hobby. They aren't getting paid to blog and any money they make from website advertising is minimal (I'm literally talking pennies a month). They've also spent years building their blog to where it is today not to mention the hours spend editing photos and posts. _In order for bloggers to work with you, your campaign needs to be something they're interested in and needs to have some benefit to them and their audience._ [![Laptop](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6645.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6645.jpg)\n\n# **Bloggers are very valuable**\n\nAs people move away from paper magazines and traditional media there is more of opportunity for bloggers to be found and heard. More and more time is spent on Twitter and Instagram with feeds filled with informative, beautiful and exciting text and images. A review of a restaurant has a lot more weight behind it than a magazine piece.  It comes straight from an everyday person not a trained journalist who has been \"fed\" lines to say or sold in a story around it (pun - smooth!) There is also the other side of the story. What happens if you're reading a restaurant review and see that it says sponsored content at the end? It's still going to be a positive review, from what I've read and heard, a blogger would never openly slate a restaurant. If the food or service etc. was bad then they would often contact the PR and let them know or plain refuse to cover it. What's the point in telling people places not to go? Why would you want to read something so openly negative after all the waiter may have had a bad day, the oven may have been broken, these things happen (trust my I know, my brother manages restaurants). It's not worth ruining someone's reputation over it. I would also hope that bloggers aren't fed lines of what to include in their review. Anytime I've worked with a blogger on a review or campaign I would have told them a little about it the why, how and what, then asked them to take a look and let us know what they think. _They're free to form their own opinions and that's whats so beautiful about hearing straight from a blogger - the originality. _\n\n# **There is a darker side to bloggers**\n\nThere are those bloggers who are doing it for the freebies. Who will straight out lay their demands on the table. To be fair to them they have a point, if they have got to the stage where they're doing it for a day job then they need to make their money. They've put a lot of time and effort into their blogs so deserve rewards from it but it shouldn't be just about the money. I hate it when I'm looking for bloggers and come across a site with review after review after review. Do you just get free stuff to try out all the time? Who reads these? And isn't it hard to always review stuff over and over? I struggle enough not to call everything amazing and awesome but then again that might just me with a tiny vocabulary!\n\n# **Follower counts**\n\nI was disappointed to see that one of the bloggers I was working with had a lot of fake followers on Twitter. I thought something was a little off when she jumped a thousand followers since the last time I looked. Now there is sometimes a legit way that may happen but don't forget that the PR you're working with usually has monitoring and social tools which can take a deeper look into your profile and see through the eggs and spammy accounts.\n\n# **There is no need to be rude**\n\nThere is usually some young intern or account executive on the other side of that email, likely to be the same age or younger than you and just doing as they were told. They are the ones who send the emails and they aren't the ones who make the plans as to where the budget is assigned. Please remember that and don't just ignore them or send a rude email back. The hardest thing when you're running a campaign is to not get replies. Anytime a blogger emails back, even if it's just to say \"no sorry this is something I'd usually charge for\" is tons better than no reply. I know some days bloggers get thousands of emails but having an out of office set maybe saying that you would love to reply but will only get in contact if it's positive or just a quick thank you but no thank you is nice to have. _All of these replies and reasons for not working on campaigns do need to be fed back up to the top so that they become more aware what works and what doesn't work with bloggers._\n\n# **Timing**\n\n_Both bloggers and brands need to keep in mind that timing may not be in their favour._ Once a campaign has taken place, brands often want to see the results immediately and will forget the bloggers often have content planned out already as well as having day jobs (and a social life somewhere along the lines!). The brands will forget that bloggers often have content planned out already and have day jobs (not to mention a social life). Some bloggers will be able to get your post up and out within a few days but for others you'll need to wait a few weeks. The key to this is to have an open conversation with the blogger and make sure you're both aware of timings. If you want to wrap something up quickly why not ask if they can post something a little earlier? Or at least a teaser tweet about the upcoming post which will likely please the client as they know something is coming without having to have the entire post. Bloggers also need to hold their side of the bargain - there's one particular example where I was working with a blogger and kept getting pushed back and pushed back, she openly lied to me which was just insulting seeing as I could see everything on her Instagram feed. Mistakes happen and if you can't blog you can't blog just be honest about it. It makes it embarrassing to report back to the teams to say your blogger relations hasn't exactly come through.\n\n# **Budget and last minute tasks**\n\n_It's important a to keep up a conversation with a PR as much as you can._ I'm at the stage with a few bloggers where I can email or tweet them and say things like \"fancy trying this? Or \"there's an event next week if you wanna grabbing a drink?\" It cuts through all the bullshit you usually have to send about the campaigns and straight off gets a yes or no answer. When working in PR you will often get something dropped in your lap last minute with the instructions to get some blog posts out of it so having this is kind of relationship is hugely valuable and amazing. Sometimes there won't be payment in it, I think it's good for a blogger to charge but accept that sometimes they will get the minimum (although always get something out of it). At the end of the day the blogger can always say no.\n\n# **Speaking out online**\n\nIn terms of the blogger blackmail moment I think it's bad form for anyone to pick fights through social media. If you have a problem with someone go and speak to them about it. I read about some Twitter spat with celebs the other day and thought - what's the point?! It's just attention seeking. The only time I speak out to a brand online is if I've been badly treated and it's difficult for me to connect with them via Twitter. Keep things between yourselves, people love drama but think about the reputations you're effecting by speaking out so bluntly. I always say to stick up for yourself but this doesn't have to be done via social media. And if you must then do it without naming people.\n\n# **And finally, the term PR**\n\nI've used the term PR throughout this mostly as it's the most recognisable description of the people I'm talking about. Yes PR is close to what I'm doing but I hate that term. Maybe it should be called social relations or digital relations or something. Anyway, I don't ring up journalists all day and I don't write press releases. In fact if you ever get a press release by me please delete it immediately as my email would have been hacked. That doesn't happen. Journalists and bloggers are in two different ball parks so keep the press releases for one and think more about tailoring how you work with the other.   That got a bit intense so here's a photo of a monkey....

      "wordpressContent": "When we first started thinking about honeymoons I had the idea of Bali in my head. Neither of us have been over to that part of the world so we decided that was as good of a reason as any! I hate making big decisions and we managed to put off looking and ended up booking the honeymoon two weeks before our wedding. I wasn't too sure what to expect as we hadn't fully researched but I think this was a good thing as we didn't have any preconceived ideas and only had a few rough plans. I would recommend the area that we stayed - Nasa Dua as it was quite quiet and perfect for a beach break. Taxis are cheap enough that you can get into the tourists sports like Kuta and Ubud fairly easily. ![Viki & Charlie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9047-1024x683.jpg) **Getting around** We spent quite a bit of time with various drivers exploring the island. You can book a driver for the day for £30 which is about a 9 hour day. Most of them have done a tourism degree so know a lot about the island and where to take you. I would recommend it if you're out there as it's the best way to see the island and learn more about the culture. Our driver took us around loads of local tourist and not so tourist attractions. In a day he took us to see a typical Balinese play, textile designers, coffee tasting, lunch (with amazing views over the rice terraces), silver smiths, a waterfall and finally dinner watching the sunset. ![Viki and sunset](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9345-1024x683.jpg) **Kuta ** We went to Kuta twice. The first time we walked down from Legion and the second we went for a more basic dinner - we got bored of the Bali food. Kuta's full of Australian backpackers and is very busy but it's also the best place to surf if you're into that. I liked the vast amount of shops around there and the different bars and restaurants. If your looking for a slightly western touch Kuta is your place however I'd recommend venturing north slightly to Legion which is pretty much the same just quieter. ![Kuta beach](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_8411-1024x759.jpg) **Ubud ** This is another key place to visit in Bali. It was around an hour from where we were staying but cost us under £10 in a taxi to get to. We went to the monkey forest after lunch which was fun. The monkeys all live there and are generally fed by the tourists buying bananas to give them. One got a little too friendly with me ..... ![Ubud monkey](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_8537-1024x683.jpg) ![Ubud monkey](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_8568-1024x683.jpg) **Temples** There is also quite a few temples around. In Bali there is at least one temple per house to warn off the evil spirits. There is usually another inside to welcome the good spirits and fortunes. Each day offerings are given and they will share the food they eat with the temple. We got given a lot of information about their religion whilst out there and it's really interesting to see something that a whole country believes in so strongly and how much time they spend worshiping and making offerings. ![Buddhist temple](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_8907-1024x683.jpg) **Trips** One of our groomsmen booked us a three day tour whilst we were there. This made sure we got to explore the north of the island too. You can book the tour in different sections and he found it as it was listed as the [second best thing](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g294226-d2307721-Reviews-Mayong_Village_Tracking_Experience-Bali.html) to do in Bali (after a water park ?!). We were picked up and taken across the island stopping off to see various rice terraces as well as lakes and Buddhist and Hindu temples. ![Rice terrace](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_8834-1024x683.jpg) The tour can also book hotels for you too and it was really nice to see a different one. This was a lot smaller then our main hotel but the two complimented each other nicely. The manager was really friendly and all the staff even put on a show on our second night. The second day started super early as we were out on a three man traditional boat at 5.45 off to watch the sunrise and dolphin spot. It was my first sunrise and it's well worth waking up for - even if I did go back to nap before breakfast! ![Sunrise](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9231-1024x683.jpg)   After we were picked up by Artana who runs the tour and taken to his house where we met a few others and set off trekking. As we went along Artana kept stopping to explain various fruits, plants and culture for us. In all it was a three hour walk and I was glad to stop off at a farmers house near the end for some fresh coconut water and fried banana. ![Coconut tree](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9279-1024x837.jpg) Yes that is him climbing the tree to get the coconut! The tour finished with lunch made by Artana's wife Ria. This is a really sweet little touch as it means you get to talk to a family and learn more about life in Bali as well as experience the traditional food - not just the tourist stuff! ![Viki in Bali](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9303-1024x683.jpg)![Rice terrace](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9300-1024x683.jpg) The final day of the tour took us back home whilst stopping off at a traditional food market - the food standards agencies would have a field day if they came across it!! My favourite part of the trip came next when we headed to the Sekympul <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">waterfall. I could have stayed in that water for hours. It was amazing to be in after the car journey. Charlie wasn't much of a fan though as his contact lenses threaten to come out and he couldn't handle the chill. Luckily I was able to amuse myself and spent a fair while splashing around the rocks like a toddler. </span> ![Waterfalls](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9412-683x1024.jpg) We managed to see all of the island we wanted to and could then spend our final days relaxing and making the most of the pool beers. ![Beer](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/P1040757-1024x768.jpg) I would really recommend visiting Bali as a holiday or honeymoon destination. These are my five reasons:\n\n*   The weather is pretty amazing - we didn't have a dull day\n*   The people are really kind - our hotel manager had cocktails with us before we left\n*   It's super cheap once you're there. £60 is a million Indonesian Rupiah so you're pretty much a millionaire\n*   There's lots of culture to explore - tons of the stuff\n*   The scenery is beautiful - speaks for itself\n\n![Beach photo](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9111-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "One of the big questions you get asked on the run up to your wedding is _how's the diet going_. Now I know you shouldn't have to lose weight for your big day, you should be happy the way you are and plenty of people will cry out that you don't need to lose weight - so why are they asking about my diet?! I hadn't even though about it until I kept getting asked. I had this idea that I'd swim twice a week and go on a few runs - I'd be back to my teenage athletic (sort of) body in no time. That wasn't exactly how it went down. Between work, wedding planning and home hunting all I wanted to do on a spare night was chill on the sofa. So I thought I might cut back on drinking and junk food a bit but nothing too bad. Then I looked at what I was eating - that Sainsburys meal deal each day isn't the healthiest thing. Luckily my buddy [Catriona](https://kiwicakes.wordpress.com/) teamed up with me to make healthier lunches at work. Okay, well by team I mean she made me lunch and I paid her the cost of the food but that still counts right? Charlie came up with the idea after reading the [four hour body](http://fourhourbody.com/). I couldn't have done it without him - I think we were both convinced we wanted to 'win' the diet! I'm not claiming to be the healthiest person in the world, this is just what I tried out and found worked for me. Here's what you need to do:\n\n*   Cut out all carbs - potatoes, bread etc etc\n*   Replace these with legumes such as lentils and black beans\n*   Cut out sugar including fruit\n*   Cut out dairy - we're about the only mammal that drinks milk past childhood - why do we need it?\n*   Drink only water other than the wine\n*   Allow yourself one (okay maybe two) glasses of red wine a day.\n\nSimple. With these easy rules I was able to cut out the crisps and fizzy drinks and feel a lot happy, healthier and cleaner in my diet. The biggest thing I noticed was how I felt in the mornings, I used to have cereal at work but now I'm having scrambled eggs, lentils and ham in the mornings - it takes about two minutes to make and means the energy hits me as I arrive into work. It's encouraged me to try out different foods, I hadn't thoughts about eating things like kidney beans before except in a chilli. There are plenty of delicious foods out there so why not try out different types? You're also allowed one cheat day a week which we ensured fell on a Saturday where you can eat all the junk you fancy. I've got a few great legume recipes (which I'll post up soon) but I'm still on the look out for more so if you have any let me know in the comments below.

      "wordpressContent": "Sundays aren't just for roast dinners! They're about having a big meal with either family or friends. Now don't expect the healthiest thing in the world from this recipe but it's pretty damn tasty and perfect to make if you have people round or just want to make a few freezer meals. This was one of my favourite uni meals to make purely because it comes in such big portions so lasted me weeks. My mum always thinks that spaghetti bolognese tastes better when it's been frozen - I think both are equally as good. The original recipe I based this on included white wine instead of red but I think you can use anything you have lying around. It also added a splash of milk with the mince, I found it makes it a little too fatty but feel free to experiment. Finally, I know I've only just posted about my new [low carb eating habits](http://vikibell.com/why-i-changed-the-way-i-eat/) so feel free top swap out the pasta for spiralized carrots and skip the cheese. For this recipe you'll need:\n\n*   3 onions\n*   3 cloves of garlic\n*   2 carrots\n*   a small pack of mushrooms\n*   1 pack of mince\n*   two or three tins of chopped tomatoes\n*   fresh tomatoes (optional)\n*   A bottle of red wine\n\n*   First up chop the onions and a few cloves of garlic\n*   Fry these in a wok in a small amount of oil (you don't want too much as the mince gives out liquid)\n*   As you do this chop or peel the carrots into tiny pieces and mushrooms - mix up the varieties depending how much you like them. By the time you've cut them it'll be time to add them into the wok.\n\n![Spag Bol](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_7518-1024x683.jpg)\n\n*   Stir together well. Once the onions have softened up add in the pack of mince (500g) alongside a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well.\n\n![Spag Bol](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_7526-1024x683.jpg)\n\n*   When the mince begins to loose its colour it's time to add the tinned tomatoes.\n*   At the point you can also add in the fresh tomatoes and a good splash of wine\n\n![Spag Bol](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_7546-1024x683.jpg)\n\n*   You can either leave it to simmer on the hob or pop it in the oven at about 180 for 30 minutes and stir it occasionally\n\n*   To make it extra healthy cover it with a layer of grated cheese for the last ten minutes to make it more into a bake\n\n![Cheese](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_7554-1024x683.jpg)\n\n*   Whilst this is melting boil some pasta to accompany it and any garlic bread you fancy\n*   Take a cheap bottle of wine and decant it to make it seem fancier (it seriously tastes so much better!)\n\n![Decant wine](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_7535-1024x683.jpg)\n\n*   Spaghetti bolognese complete.

      "wordpressContent": "I first got to know Grant back in school when we were in art class together. His final piece involved copper piping puncturing an old wooden door whilst I painted over smashed glass and twigs. The theme was discord. It means that I've been there since (almost) the beginning and I've had the chance to hear the different genres of music that he's experimented with, all the time adding his unique style. From a Grant screaming on stage at a gig in Rayleigh to a more acoustic, folk Grant playing in Leeds. He recently came to down to London to meet some producers and it was lovely to spend a week with him staying at ours. Having someone who's constantly creative and witty around is really refreshing from normal life. Of course he couldn't come down to London without playing a gig which is why we found ourselves, beer in hand of course, in the Monarch in Camden last Tuesday evening.![Grant](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9842-1024x683.jpg) Grant was first up with the tough job of warming up the crowd which he did with ease. Soon enough you could skim the room and see his music making the crowd move and shake. ![Grant](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9833-1024x683.jpg) Because of the vast amount of songs he writes and the infrequent times we see him I'm always lucky enough to hear his new stuff as well as some old favourites. Grant's music is super unique to him and different to anything I've heard before. If I had to choose something similar it would have to be a kind of Van Morrison or Fleet Foxes sound. But it's almost if he's taken their style turned it inside out, added a few ingredients and baked something new out of it. ![Grant](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9853-1024x683.jpg) If you're in Leeds then watch out for [Cottonwoolf](http://www.cottonwoolf.com) who Grant's currently performing with. He's also releasing a new solo album under a different name and will be back in London again soon but for now have a listen to his songs over on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/grant-k.-fennell/id450692647) or [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/grant-fennell).

The whole of Autumn has an almost magical, spooky feel to it which explains why I like Halloween so much! I think it might be my favourite season, summer being my second as you can lie out in the sunshine but it often disappoints if it just doesn't reach the high temperatures. Whereas Autumn is where the changes happen - hot turns to cold and the trees change to orange. The sun rises much later and lower as well giving you some beauty in your mornings and great photos. [![](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_7184.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_7184.jpg) I'm sat on the train on the way in from Southend today after seeing a Charlie's grandparents for dinner and the sunrise has me really looking forward to a change, not just in temperature but in lifestyle too. With the wedding over we've finally got time to decorate our house and concentrate more on doing things differently. I want to try and make the most out of living in London now and see different things. Maybe go to some more galleries or events or just take walks with no destination and explore.

      "wordpressContent": "Post wedding you're supposed to send thank you cards to all your guests right? Well our wedding was hardly a normal one so we thought we'd be a little different and give our guests one final chuckle in the form of a thank you video. I thought I'd share it with you too as it's the first proper video I've edited alone. It took us about an hour of filming and quite a few more hours of editing to create. I like to think that it was well worth the effort and fun for everyone to look back on. I'd like to experiment more with videos and editing so watch this space. The video says it all but thank you to everyone who helped to make our day so memorable. We've had such good feedback on the day and a lot of people have said it was the best wedding they've been too.  We'd planned out so much before meaning we could be laid back on the day and the run up. Nothing was too much of an effort and even though we made more work for ourselves by making our own table plan and photo booth we really didn't mind - about 5pm the day before I was casually painting the table plan in the garden! We left things a bit loose on the day too meaning we could mix around the order of things like the first dance and the bouquet toss. It wouldn't have worked if we didn't have such flexible caterers and photographer. Absolutely everyone was so happy and smiley all day! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TldyjMknmjs#action=share Aaaaannnnddddd the outtakes - because we wouldn't be completely serious! .... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7wYEvCiWIA#action=share",

      "wordpressContent": "We've found that as Charlie and my weeks get booked up we hardly have a night together so we've set a Thursday evening as date night. It's the one night of the week where we know we should be seeing each other, even if it just means we both get home on time and cook together. To celebrate Charlie getting a new job I'd been thinking of places to take him for dinner, luckily we were invited to the Millennium Hotel in Gloucester Road to try out their [Italian restaurant](http://www.millenniumhotels.co.uk/millenniumbaileys/dining/olives-restaurant.html) and have a few glasses of fizz. ![Champagne](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9909-683x1024.jpg) The hotel had some refurbishment going on so we took a sneaky peek into one of the new suites. These stairs were pretty impressive but luckily they have a lift to get you up there!   [![](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_7305-0.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_7305-0.jpg)  The suite had anything you'd need in a mini house including this funky mirror... [![Charlie & I ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9939-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9939.jpg) I had to refrain from jumping on the bed and I was quite tempted to run myself a bath but thought that might be a bit much so we made our way down the giant staircase and into dinner where we sat down to a glorious three course meal. ![Bath](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9930-1024x683.jpg) Over wine we were able to try out a selection of the starters although if I had to pick a favourite it would be the cold meat selection. [![Starters](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9956-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9956.jpg) [![Starters](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9959-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9959.jpg)I always get a little stuck picking Italian food. Choosing a pasta dish is hard as I want to taste most of them! It's also something we're pretty good at making at home so I went for salmon - something I don't usually cook, salmon. I made the right choice! It was so beautifully presented with a beetroot sauce. I like to think that your first taste is taken by your eyes so presentation for me is one of the most important aspects of a meal.     [![Salmon](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9976-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9976.jpg) Charlie went for the steak which he loved. I could also tell he was super impressed with the waiters who clearly knew a lot about the wine they were serving. Of course we had to try both red and white! [![Steak](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9971-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9971.jpg)[![Wine](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9967-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9967.jpg) As desserts were served the chef came out to tell us a little more about his menu and run through the desserts. I really enjoyed the fact that he looks for local connections in his ingredients. Although I'm not usually a dessert person the presentations were so pretty I had to try some. The a<span class=\"s1\">pple and chestnuts strudel with calvados sauce was my favourite followed by the w</span><span class=\"s1\">hite chocolate and lavender crème brûlée in close second. </span> ![Dessert](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9985-1024x685.jpg) The Millennium hotel was really cute. The restaurant doesn't really feel like you were in a hotel. It's quite small with dim lighting which takes it away from feeling like something too generic.",

      "wordpressContent": "I'd been planning this surprise with one of our groomsmen, Lewis, since August. As far as Charlie knew we were heading off for a weekend in Amsterdam as a wedding present- we were actually going to Florence, somewhere top on Charlie's travel list. Lewis is not the best organiser so Charlie was worried when he hadn't asked for our passports or told us any details. He had no idea! Once we got to Stansted we ring Lewis who excitedly told us the news that we were off for a weekend of culture and delicious food and wine. ![Pisa](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0438-1024x683.jpg) We found that the flights were about a third cheaper if we flew into Pisa so stayed there the first night. Everyone had warned me that there wasn't much to see and they were right. After taking a few snaps of the leaning tower, we had breakfast nearby before catching the train to Florence. It's only an hour away so if you're in either of those places make sure to visit the other. ![Viki in Pisa](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Viki-683x1024.jpg)![Pisa](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0447-683x1024.jpg) I had booked us an Airbnb for our stay - I'd never used them before but it worked out really well. I don't see why you would book a generic hotel when you can stay in such niche little places. On arrival our host presented us with a map which he went through and explained the best places to visit around town. We decided to have a wonder around on our first night and ended up on a street he had recommended enjoying pizza and a bottle or two of Chianti. [![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0497-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0497.jpg)![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0502-1024x683.jpg) On Sunday we walked to a piazza and saw some of the statues there. We made a bit of a mistake having breakfast on the piazza which ended up quite expensive. It's a little harder to find breakfast down a back street in Florence so I'd recommend planning ahead slightly more than we did. You can always get a feel of the price based on an expresso which ranges from €1-4\\. After breakfast we took a walk across the famous bridge and found ourselves in another square looking at a church and market. I thought it was strange that there was the odd beer bottle lying around before I realised that we were in the square where the locals hung out on a Saturday night. [![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0471-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0471.jpg) Charlie wanted a cold meats and cheese lunch so we stumbled upon this cute little shop which had room out the back for you to sit. It has to be one of our funniest meals as the waitress was a little old lady who didn't speak a word of English. After pointing at a few things and guessing what the menu meant we managed to get our meats and cheese - as well as another bottle of Chianti! The couple next to us were less than impressed though and quickly said yes to her suggestion of lasagne, wolfed down the food and were off. They might have looked at it as a bad lunch but for us it was more of an linguistical adventure. [![](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7383.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7383.jpg) Afterwards we went up to the [Pitti Palace](https://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/en/musei/pitti.php?m=palazzopitti). We had planned to see the sunset over by the statue of David and didn't think we had time to do both the palace and the gardens so opted in for the gardens. Our step count of the day was off the scale! We climbed so many hills and stairs over the space of that garden we definitely ended up working off our lunch. ![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0582-1024x683.jpg)![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0542-1024x771.jpg) We found a side exit to the gardens and it was another uphill climb to get to the statue of David. Unfortunately it was so cloudy we didn't see much of a sunset but at least we had a great view of the city. ![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0626-1024x683.jpg) We were recommended to try out [Lungarno](http://www.lungarnobistrot.it/) for dinner and it turned out to be my favourite meal in Florence. The restaurant didn't seem too busy and I get the feeling that it was fairly new but all the staff were very happy and at tentative to your meal. I loved the fact that we were greeted with a glass of prosecco - a really cute touch. We both wanted to share the Florentine steak so opted to share scallops for starters. I have no idea how Italians can go for dinner and have a starter, pasta and then a main the food is delicious but we just couldn't eat that much! ![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0633-1024x683.jpg) ![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0636-1024x683.jpg) Monday was an early start. We planned to get to the Duomo before the crowds and were lucky enough to get to the top around 8.30 when the mist was just beginning to rise. It's well worth a visit and a quick climb to the top. ![Duomo](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0647-1024x683.jpg) ![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0666-1024x683.jpg)![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0676-1024x683.jpg) We were in and out the Duormo quicker than we thought which meant we had some time to spare. After ticking off pretty much everything on our tourist list I was more than happy to wonder the streets. We took a look at the leather markets, sat in a park, accidentally ended up in the university and of course had another long lunch! ![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0679-1024x683.jpg) At 2.30 we headed off to [Di Vinci Alive](http://www.davincialive.it/the-exhibition/) which was only on until 2nd November. I was taught about Di Vinci in uni but I hadn't taken too much of the details in so it was good to spend some time just learning about his life and the amount he accomplished. At the end there was a giant projection of his quotes and work across the walls of a church. We sat for around half an hour just letting it all soak in. We headed across to the food market afterwards. Downstairs is laid out like a usual street market with open fish counters and meat delis but upstairs is full of seating and people enjoying a coffee or glass of wine. It had a really cool vibe to it even though there didn't seem to be much going on. I don't think I'd go there for food but it's worth having a glass of wine and taking a look at the stalls. Charlie got into man mode with his admiration of the meats. [![Market](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0681-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0681.jpg) After a quick outfit change, we headed out to our last meal. We'd booked a really lovely restaurant but it didn't quite beat our meal the night before. For some reason I couldn't stop putting things into song as we walked there, I can't sing in the slightest so this wasn't a good move but it made the evening really funny and earned us a few strange looks. We pretty much had one full meal between us sharing breads, pasta and then a chicken dish. [![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0693-1024x683.jpg)![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0687-1024x683.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0681.jpg) I made sure to book us a late flight on the Tuesday so we had a full day to enjoy. We couldn't leave Florence without a look around the Uffitzi! It took us two hours in total and I think that might be record breaking. At first I couldn't get over the beauty of the rooms as the detail in the artwork. As we went on I got a bit bored of seeing nude statue and painting after painting of Madonna and Jesus - sorry to all the art historians!! I really appreciated the artwork in there but there was just a bit too much for me to take in. I preferred some of the landscape paintings which are displayed nearer the end. Overall the gallery has inspired me to start painting again so watch this space. ![Uffitzi](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0715-683x1024.jpg) We had our last lunch near the station which of course included pasta, pizza and another bottle of Chianti! Then it was time to catch the train back to Pisa, stop off for some sunshine beers and then head back to rainy England. ![Florence](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0563-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Last week we went to the annual [Jane Packer Foundation](http://thejanepackerfoundation.com/) Flower Ball. I'd never been to a ball before so wasn't too sure what to expect. But I can tell you that if every ball is like that you can sign me up to the next one now! ![Viki](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0833-1024x683.jpg) It was hosted at the Hurlingham club and as we arrived the staff were smiling and handing us champagne and corsages. I had expected the room to be full of beautiful flowers and I wasn't disappointed. Each table has a different tree coming from the center. Apparently the staff had been working on the set up all day and the effort they put into it really shone through. ![IMG_0776](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0776-1024x683.jpg)![centrepiece](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0736-1024x683.jpg) Dinner passed in a glorious blur and I was too wrapped up in our conversations to actually take any photos - except of the menu of course! ![](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_7558.jpg) Our table was nonstop laughter as we begin the silent auction and it didn't show any signs of slowing down an auctioneer from Sotheby's took the stage for the main auction. Our table ended up winning (I'm not sure if you would call it winning?!) three out of the four lots and were complained on our auctioning skills. Then it was time to hit the dance floor and try out the photo-booth. ![Photobooth](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20151022223122-1024x683.jpg)   I'm so pleased that I had the opportunity to go to the ball and help raise some money for the Jane Packer foundation. There was so much energy in the room and you could tell that everyone there had a brilliant time no thanks to Gary and his team. Although I was only able to meet Jane a handful of times, Gary and his family mean a lot to me and my time in Suffolk. This is precisely the reason I chose [Jane Packer](http://www.jane-packer.co.uk/) for my wedding flowers back in [July](http://vikibell.com/wedding-day-part-i/). Congratulations to Gary and the wonderful Jane Packer team who put on a magnificent event. ![Jane Packer](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/h-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "I love Halloween. I love that it falls on a time of year when the leaves are a crunchy autumnal mess and when the nights are getting spookier. I love planning a fancy dress outfit and getting creative with it. And I love seeing how everyone takes on their characters. We were on holiday last year which meant we skipped all that so this year I was determined to make up for it this year. On Friday night Milly, Charlie and I headed into Soho for a spooky game launch. The venue certainly had a halloween feel to it with witches offering themed canapés and suits of armour standing guard. We headed through towards what looked like a Hogwarts classroom to try out making a few potions. Of course we had to try them first! We started off with a smoking vodka concoction which I think was my favourite. ![Smoking Vodka](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0854-1024x683.jpg) The second was a rum mix which the mixologist was very excited about as he set it alight and screamed \"glitter fire\" whilst pouring things over it. You can't really tell from the photo but there was a glitter fire! [![Cocktail](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0858-e1447073399905-1024x718.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0858.jpg) The third was colour changing. Again the photos don't do it justice so you'll have to take my word for it - it was blue and changed to a purple pink hue. ![Cocktail](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0893-1024x683.jpg) We were then showed this strange mango mix which looks a bit like caviar. It solidifies in a drink and I thought all the balls looked a bit like that scene in Finding Nemo - you know before all Nemo's siblings get eaten. ![Cocktail](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0865-683x1024.jpg) ![Cocktail making](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0878-e1446884705587-1024x724.jpg) The cocktails weren't just spooky for Halloween - they were all themed around King's new Bubble Witch Saga 2 game. We had a chance to play it and Charlie and I got a bit competitive against each other - although I still don't think he knows I cheated! ![Bubble Witch](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_08471-e1446884650897-844x1024.jpg) The game also inspired some Halloween makeovers which we tried out. These were based on some of the characters and made us look great for our dinner at Grillshack afterwards. ![Makeup](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0908-1024x683.jpg) ![Face paint](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7566.jpg) On Saturday we had booked a Halloween banquet at [Pond](http://pond-dalston.com/) in Dalston but hadn't quite got around to planning our outfits. After breakfast I found myself surrounded by our fancy dress options as we decided on scary clowns. After a quick dash to the market to get Charlie a pair of lovely women's trousers, we went about creating out looks. We used spray paint, material, old clothes, pillows, hair spray, face paint and of course a fair amount of fake blood. This was the result... ![Fancy dress](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7577-1024x768.jpg)![Fancy Dress](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7579-1024x768.jpg) Heads turned as we walked in and someone even wanted her photo taken with us. Matt came as Patrick Bateman which was worryingly accurate and his brother Rob was Morty from Rick and Morty. Whenever we do fancy dress together we each slightly become our character meaning that at conversation breaks Charlie and I started doing a spooky dance staring at someone else, Matt grinned like a mad man and rob acted drunk (although I'm not too sure how much acting was involved by the end of the night) [![Patrick Bateman ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7580-768x1024.jpg)![Scary Clowns](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7669-1024x768.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7669.jpg) On Sunday after we'd washed out all the face paint we headed to my Nan and Grandad's for a big Sunday roast. Just what we needed. ![Sunday roast ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7686-1024x1024.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Hannah and I skipped out of work early on Friday and headed to City Airport. We were off to Rotterdam. I hadn't flown from City before so was excited to see a new airport. It's pretty much how you'd expect - full off city workers going home for the weekend but at least we could grab a few beers before our flight. ![Airport beer](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7704-1024x768.jpg) The flight took no time at all, before they had even finished the drinks service we were already descending. We still only got to Cat's quite late so decided to chill with a few glasses off fizz around the fire. ![Champagne](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7711-1024x1024.jpg) After a continental breakfast on Saturday morning we jumped on some bikes and headed out for a tour of the city. We started off in the Kralingse Bos, which had a lake with a great view of Rotterdam. I can imagine how lovely it is during the summer but it was the perfect place to wipe the cobwebs away with an autumn walk through the trees. ![Park](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0952-1024x683.jpg) Afterwards we were in need of coffee so headed to central Rotterdam and the Saturday market. We were told by our trusty tour guide that the market had been there as long as she can remember selling everything from vegetables to bras! We stopped off to get a Stroopwafel – yes, yes it is bigger than Hannah’s head! ![Stroopwafel](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0954-1024x683.jpg) Then we headed into the relatively new market hall which is surrounded by flats and has a really decorative roof. Inside you can find all sorts of delicious foods and drinks. Of course I got a little excited by the tomato stall. ![Tomatoes](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0962-1024x683.jpg)![Market](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0960-683x1024.jpg) We jumped back on the bikes and across the Erasmus Bridge to the south part of Rotterdam. I loved the old buildings over here so got a little trigger happy with my camera. Cat's dad had told us that there were very few old buildings in the city as it was so heavily bombed in the war so I wonder if these were some of them? ![Bridge](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0981-1024x683.jpg)![Rotterdam](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0984-e1447614244274-1024x638.jpg)   After distracting ourselves with the buildings we went into the Fenix Food Factory which is a tiny little food market next to a small brewery in what looks like an old warehouse. We bought a cheese platter and tried out a few of the beers. ![Cheese](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_77241-1024x1024.jpg) These beers didn't quite compare to what we tried when we got home however. Cat's dad told us a story of the best beer in the world and how on his first attempt at getting some he rung up over 300 times. Have you heard of Westvleteren? Well it's brewed by monks in a Belgian monastery and you're only allowed to buy some if you ring up at a certain time. _IF_ you manage to get through you're given a time slot to arrive for collection of two crates only and you have to give the number plate of the car you'll be driving. It's all very strict so once you finally get hold of the beer you don't really want to share it - unless it's with us! Cat's dad was really kind and opened up two bottles for us to try. These were the Westvleteren 12 (10.2%!) but there's the Westvleteren Blonde and 8 as well. The 12 is more popular but whilst we were there we found that they were selling the 8 on Tuesday - luckily Cat volunteered to ring to try and get some – it _ONLY_ took her 70 minutes to get through this time! You may need to take my word for it but they tasted amazing. ![Beer](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7727-1024x1024.jpg) Best beer in the world down it was time to head to Amsterdam. Cat's brother Robert was having a leaving party for a flat mate so we used it as our excuse to visit.A few years ago the boys had been asked to move out for a month whilst converse took over their home. They didn't know too much of what went on but they were left with these incredible artworks all over the wall. I couldn't get over how great they looked. The house is in need of a bit of TLC but that brought out these paintings so much more. Words can't really explain so here's a few photos: ![Amsterdam](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1009-1024x683.jpg)![Amsterdam](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1007-1024x683.jpg)   The next day Robert took us all on a walking tour of Amsterdam. We went down the antique shopping streets, saw the Dam (the main square) and of course had a gander at the red light district, each time crossing over the famous little bridges and canals. ![Amsterdam](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1019-1024x683.jpg) Then it was time to head back to Rotterdam for our last evening. After a cheeky nap on the train and a quick sauna at home, we were ready to jump back on our bikes and head into town. One of Cat's favourite restaurants in Rotterdam happens to be Moroccan so we headed there. I was a little too excited by the prospect of food and all the crazy decorations around me to take many photos but it was delicious. If you're ever in Rotterdam I highly recommend The Bazar. [![IMG_7775](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7775-1024x1024.jpg)](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7775.jpg) The next morning we headed out for our early flight to get back to work on time. The best part about flying at this time had to be that we were flying with the sunrise. ![Sunrise](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7797-1024x768.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "It's usually a struggle for me to decide what to cook for dinner. By the time I get back and start thinking about food I either don't have all the ingredients or it will take ages to make what I planned. I normally end up Googling a recipe and make it up from there. That's exactly what this was as I fancied some white fish but didn't have my usual ingredients. **Ingredients: **\n\n*   Half onion\n*   Handful olives\n*   4 cloves of garlic\n*   Splash of milk\n*   White fish\n*   Crushed peas\n*   Half onion\n*   Balsamic splash\n*   Cayenne pepper\n*   Asparagus and broccoli\n\nFirst roughly chop half an onion and a few handfuls of olives, add four peeled cloves of garlic and season. Next put your white fish into a small dish and scatter the other ingredients on top. I used frozen Coley but any type of white fish will do. Add a dash of milk, cover with foil and pop in the oven for about 30 minutes on a medium heat - I cooked it on low as I wasn't sure when we would be eating but 30 minutes on about 170 will work just as well. Just double check the recommended time on the packaging of the fish you've chosen. ![Fish](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7547-e1447421434126-1024x732.jpg) When it was almost done start on the veg. Again this all depends on your timings but you could do the peas ahead of time and pop them in the bottom of the oven to stay warm. Start by frying half a chopped onion as you microwave some frozen peas (quantity is up to you). Once both are pretty cooked add them together and roughly mash them. Then put them back in the frying pan for a few minutes with a splash of balsamic and a sprinkling of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick. ![Peas](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7550-e1447421521595-1024x790.jpg) As you're doing this you can be steaming other vegetables. I had asparagus and broccoli in the fridge so I steamed these and then fried them off slightly to give them a bit of crispiness. Finally just lay everything out nicely on a plate (of throw it on as I did) and serve with a bottle of wine. ![White fish ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_75541-1024x925.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "The past few weeks have been fairly hectic for me and there isn't much sign of slowing down. As I'd been away last weekend Charlie and I decided it was time for a date night and headed off to [Le Mercury](http://www.lemercury.co.uk/) in Islington. It's a little french restaurant that I'm guessing used to be an old town house. The food is relatively cheap for London with main courses around £11 and £5 for starters. I'd rung for a reservation on Friday lunchtime and luckily got one of the last tables so make sure you book. ![Le Mercury ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7868-1024x1024.jpg) We had the Camembert for starter as Charlie hadn't had it before - I went to Tenerife earlier in the year and had it pretty much every meal time! It wasn't quite as nice as the ones in Tenerife which was a little upsetting, I think having something more in it would have been nicer. I'd try out the other starters next time as there was lots on the menu that looked good. ![Camembert ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7857-1024x768.jpg) Our mains more than made up for our poor choice in starter. I went with the Magret de Canard - roast breast of barbary duck, garlic potato purée, savoy cabbage, red wine jus. Charlie chose Suprême de Pintade - roast breast of guinea fowl on garlic potato purée, french beans, green peppercorn sauce. Both tasted divine and were generous portions for the price. The guinea fowl was nice and light which was what Charlie was after whereas my duck was really rich and flavoursome ![Duck](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7864-1024x768.jpg)![Guinea Fowl](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7863-1024x768.jpg) We just about had room for dessert - something we quite often skip but I'm so glad we didn't. I had the Banoffee Pie which always reminds me of the first time I had it with Charlie's dad in Portugal and Charlie had the cheese selection. We had our standard after dinner drinks of Port and an Amaretto. ![Dessert](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7878-1024x768.jpg) ![Candle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7879-768x1024.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "As a bit of a spontaneous trip a few of us decided to try out the new darts place near Mooregate, [Flight Club](http://flightclubdarts.com/). On a Monday night. With champagne. ![Champagne](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_7948.jpg) I've only ever played darts whilst messing around at my grandparents so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought of it as a bit of an old mans game but Flight Club had jazzed it up a fair amount. As you arrive it looks like a normal bar except there are booths around the wall with games of darts going on. We were taken to our area and shown the controls. The board is electronic so knows where you've hit and the screen above tells you where you should be aiming. I really liked the design of the interface. We took a selfie which comes up when it's your turn. I think my favourite button on the controls was the 'more drink' button which sends a waiter to take your orders. I mean that totally makes sense and isn't just us being lazy right? ![Flight club](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_7955.jpg) After taking advantage of the booze and food button (their pizzas were SO GOOD) we started with a game of killer. Like I said, I hadn't played darts properly before and wasn't sure of the rules but got the hang of it pretty quickly. I just struggled getting the dart to go where I wanted luckily I wasn't the only one. The fast paced nature of the game meant even with 8 of us playing you didn't have to wait long for a turn. ![Flight club](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_7959.jpg) Whether it was my inner darts champion, the champagne or beginners luck, I was winning half way through. Unfortunately I managed to loose that place pretty quickly in the second half and ended up coming last. Winning or losing it was a really fun night and somewhere I'd recommend trying with a couple of friends.",

      "wordpressContent": "A simple and tasty dinner you can make for one, two or a whole dinner party. I'd bought some puff pastry a while back as I was planning on making a feta and roasted vegetable pie for a vegetarian friend of mine. Long story short, our plans changed and I wasn't sure what to do with the pastry. I often make chicken pie but with no chicken in the freezer that wasn't an option. Instead I threw together this tasty dinner using the contents of my kitchen. ![Salmon and spinach pie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1062-1024x708.jpg) Chop up one red onion and a few cloves of garlic. Fry these in a little olive oil until the onion begins to lose its colour, then add in a few handfuls of spinach. I defrosted some frozen spinach as it breaks up more easily than fresh and gives a more even flavour. Season, throw in a few handfuls of pine nuts and fry everything off for a few minutes. Meanwhile seal the outsides of your salmon fillets in a separate pan. ![Onion and spinach mix](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1036-1024x683.jpg)Once all this is heated you can roll out your pastry. I left mine quite thick and square but it depends how many people you're feeding/ how many salmon fillets you're using. Place the salmon in the middle and the spinach mix neatly on top. Fold everything inwards and cover with a beaten egg. Don't forget to puncture the top to let the air out before putting in the oven for about 25 minutes. ![Salmon](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1038-1024x683.jpg)   Once the top is nice and crispy, take it out and serve. I made potato and sweet potato mustard mash and garlic mushrooms to go with it. There you have it, my salmon and spinach pastry. ![Salmon and spinach pie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1047-1024x659.jpg) ![Salmon and spinach pie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1060-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Whether it's for Christmas or birthdays I always spend ages thinking about the person I'm buying a gift for and asking myself what do they want, what do they do and what can I give them that will make their life easier, better or more enjoyable. I know I covered roughly the questions you should ask yourself in last year's [post](http://vikibell.com/my-guide-to-gifts/) so this year I thought I'd share a few ideas I've come up with or have done before.![Christmas tree](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1443-1024x683.jpg) **Get crafty and make something. ** Why give presents only in December? There are so many things around like BirchBox, Graze or Not Another Bill which send you deliveries each week or month. Why not sign someone up to one of these or put together your own. One idea I had (which I might still use so I'm hoping she doesn't read this!) is a hamper with a present for each month in it - meaning your festive cheer is spread through the year! On their birthday month you might have champagne, a scarf for November when it starts to get cold, a good book or some holiday spending money for the summer. You get the gist. **Make the way you give your presents a little different. ** One year instead of just giving presents like normal we decided to make it into a treasure hunt. We drew a (roughly) to scale map of my parents house and wrote clues to the various hiding places. Somehow it transformed my fifteen year old brother into a giggling kid again and my parents even had massive grins of their faces as they searched the house. I can't say what it is that I'm doing for Charlie this year but I'm planning to do a similar thing but inspired from one of the TV shows we've been watching recently - White Collar. **![Christmas tree](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1445-1024x683.jpg)** **Get an experience ** Part of Christmas Day is always around the tussle of wrapping paper and the look on someone's face when you surprise them with something special. But what about afterwards? There is so much build up and so much pressure to buy material things but what about something to look forward to? There are lots of things out there to book so here's a few ideas:\n\n*   Theatre tickets\n*   A fancy dinner\n*   Flights to somewhere\n*   A spa break\n*   A weekend in London\n*   A cooking course\n*   A course learning something new\n*   Tickets to an exhibition\n*   Tickets to an event\n*   An IOU for a weekends activities\n\n**Personalise something  ** Now I'm not just talking the normal things like key rings and photo frames. Why not try out making something a little different. Perhaps a personalised cook book with some of the families favourite recipes or custom made deck of cards? For my secret Santa one year I bought a bottle of wine but made a personalised fun label to go over the top. Suddenly it isn't such a dull present. ![Christmas tree](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1452-1024x683.jpg) **Make the way they use it different** In the same way as I put the label on the wine one year, Charlie gave his mum a bottle of wine but with the instructions to enjoy it with a specific friend. This could work with the cheapest presents to the most expensive to cost shouldn't be an issue here. You could give someone a Costa card and tell them to catch up with a specific old friend over coffee. You could give vouchers to a fancy restaurant or hotel stay with the idea that they will get some time away with their partner. Or you might give a present with the instructions to only open it when you think you'll need whats underneath - that way they might not get a present on Christmas day but they will get something later on in the year.   And yes these have been photos of my tree which I'm pretty proud of! ![Christmas tree](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1449-1024x683.jpg)",

When I first came up with the idea of writing a blog it was to encourage me to get out and enjoy London (and the world) rather than going to the same pubs and places all the time. It has helped massively. There has been times when I've weighed up going home and having an early night but instead I've gone out and had an incredible time doing something different. It's the reason we're off to Germany next week to check out the Christmas markets and it's the reason I've met loads of great people at various blogger events. Writing a blog helps you open your eyes to what's around you and make the most of it all. As Charlie was getting ready to launch my new design this weekend something happened and the blog was gone. I left the room and waited, hoping he could fix it. As I waited I started thinking about it all, it's just words and pictures; I have the memories still in my head. But all that time, all that work and all those stories for people to read. Even if I scroll through my posts I'm amazed at how many I've done and how many snippets of my life I've given out. I decided that yes, I would be upset if it all disappeared and I think I would just have to start again. Blogging has opened my eyes to so many different experiences, people and ways of thinking that it's worth the time and effort. It makes me so happy when someone I'm with mentions a certain post and even if I lost all my readers tomorrow I pretty sure would continue to blog. Saying that, I don't think blogging should be about the comments or the likes or the retweets or the freebies. Blogging should be something that you do for yourself and because you want to share insights with others or reflect on what you've done. This is the reason why, with the new design, you'll no longer find a comments section on here. Blogging isn't about that stats for me, it's about the experiences and enjoyment. ![blog](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/blog-e1449234639193-1024x663.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Shooting is something that Charlie does once a year so I've heard a lot of stories about it. This time I decided to see tag along and experience it. The shoot was organised by Charlie's dad, David and was up near Bury St Edmunds. We caught the train up on Friday evening and arrived at the pub just in time for dinner and to meet everyone. The pub served some really gamey dishes but I stuck with duck parfait (okay that is gamey!) for starter followed by steak. Charlie was a little more adventurous with his starter and opted for pigeon corn dogs. I'd been warned about having to wake up at the crack of dawn but David explained to me how the next day was going to work and luckily it didn't start as early as I'd expected! ![Gun](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1187-1024x683.jpg) We were up and having a big breakfast by 8, before putting on our kit and heading down the road to the shoot. It was held on the land of a big country house and we were all in the back of a trailer called a gun bus which took us between the drives (shoots). We started out by the pond on a duck shoot. There were so many of them but you are told how many you can shoot so once you've done your amount you stop. ![Duck shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1095-1024x683.jpg) I wasn't sure how I felt about the idea of seeing something die which is one of the reasons I wanted to come along. I had a bit of a wobbly moment when I saw my first duck hit out of the air and die in the water. It seems quite harsh when they don't die straight away but there isn't too much you can do especially when they're bred to be shot. Either way I enjoyed standing on the bridge and shooting with my camera! ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1147-1024x728.jpg) Next up was pheasant and partridge. This was a lot slower as we had to wait for the beaters to walk about a mile to bring them all in towards us. In a shoot everyone pulls a number out of a hat at the beginning and that dictates where you are in the semi circle of guns. You move up numbers as the shoot goes on so that you each get a turn in each position. I got a little distracted by just looking around the views on this one. It was so nice to be out of London and in the middle of nowhere. ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1203-1024x683.jpg) ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1210-1024x683.jpg) The third drive was on more of an open space so I could see everyone taking their turns as the pheasants flew overhead. As the beaters walk along they literally beat the bushes and tap the trees to scare the birds and send them towards us. You could see them working their way towards us. They also help to collect all the birds at the end and put them on the back of a truck ready to be made into pâté and what not later on. ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1272-1-1024x683.jpg) Quite a few dogs are around which are trained to help collect the animals. In this particular drive the dogs were aching to do their own hunting and jumped forwards as soon as a pheasant landed on the ground. They were all so well trained and immediately ran back to their owners when called. We also had Charlie.... ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1304-1024x683.jpg) After this drive we stopped for elevensies which was sausages rolls and either a sloegasm (sloe gin and champagne) or Norfolk nog (half whisky, half baileys). Apparently this helps you stop shaking the gun if you're really cold! ![Elevensies](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_8217-1024x768.jpg) On the third drive I had a go at shooting and with the help of David's directions I managed to hit a pheasant. They came out so quickly from the bushes that you hardly have time to raise the gun and take aim. I had had a go at clay shooting before but this was a lot more fun as its so quick and unpredictable. I'd got my one hit so I was satisfied and passed the gun back for the last drive. ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1192-970x1024.jpg) This was my favourite. We were nearby the giant landowners house (mansion?!) and there were two rather inquisitive horses keeping an eye on us. The sun was dipping lower and the trees seemed to have so much colour to them. We were behind all the other guns so could walked up and down which meant I was able to watch everyone at once and get lots of different photo angles. ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1376-1024x683.jpg) ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1385-1024x683.jpg) ![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1427-1024x683.jpg) The sun started to dip even lower so it was back on the gun bus and time for lunch at the farmers house. Everyone gets a chance to take some of the birds they had shot. Charlie and I took back a brace of ducks which we made dinner with on the Tuesday afterwards. The extra game gets sold to restaurants or shipped to France where it's made into pâté so it all gets used up.![Shooting](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1430-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Another month another weekend break. This time we decided that the German Christmas markets were a must see and booked some last minute flights to Germany. Past Viki decided to play a mean trick on present Viki by booking flights leaving Gatwick at 6am. It was an early start.   We landed in Munich about 9am and after dropping our bags headed straight to Mariplatz - central Munich to look around the markets. I love all the little huts the stalls are in and it didn't seem too busy - thankfully. Charlie has been to Munich a few times before and knew exactly where to take me for lunch - Hofbrauhaus. It seemed to be a good mix of locals and tourists and the long tables give it a good atmosphere as everyone talks together. We shared a sausage platter and Pork knuckle, I think my favourite was the pork knuckle as I'm not as much of a fan of the typical hot-dog type sausage. Give me a Cumberland any day! *queue sausage joke*. Of course a stein of beer is a must. And so it begins.... ![Beer](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1701-1024x683.jpg) After we had a look around the other markets in central Munich. We'd been told to visit the medieval market and have a typical drink there made up of mulled wine with a shot of rum and and sugar cube which is on fire - very warming! ![IMG_1469](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1469-1024x683.jpg) Next we took a stroll around the English gardens where we saw people surfing in the river - very chilly. It was a really nice walk and very pretty as the sun was setting. I'd love to come back in the summer and chill in the sunshine. ![English Gardens](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_14722-1024x683.jpg) It had been a long day but we wanted to make the most of it so went off to the last market of the day, a more alternative one called Tollwood. This was my favourite market in Germany, it feels like a festival with giant tents and the lighting at night is amazing. There was a theme of recycling and waste which meant there was loads of mini exhibitions to explore as well as the usual stalls and bars. ![Tollwood](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1521-1024x683.jpg) ![Tollwood](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1524-1024x683.jpg) On Saturday we had a bit of a lie in and got the train to Nuremberg to see their Christmas market. It's supposed to be one of the best and it definite lived up to expectations. We managed to get most of our presents there and were done in time for lunch -speed shopping! ![Nuremberg ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1546-1024x683.jpg) ![Christmas market](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1544-e1450882860996-683x1024.jpg) After we took a walk around the city but we didn't feel like doing anything touristy so caught the train home in order to have a more relaxed dinner back in Munich. A friend had told us that Italian was a must whilst in Munich as there are so many Italians living there. Afterwards we found ourselves at a jazz bar. If you're in Munich take a look at the Jazz scene as there seems to be bars all over the place. ![Jazz bar](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1573-1024x683.jpg) On Sunday we found ourselves on another train heading to Salzberg. I'd never been to Austria so was keen to tick off another country and get another shot glass (I collect them). Both Salzberg and Nuremberg were only around 1.5 hours away from Munich so worth a trip.   We hadn't really planned what to do once we got to Salzberg other than see the market so, surprise surprise, we headed there first. It was a similar kind of layout to the German ones but there seemed to be less variety of different things. Of course there's a lot of fluffy hats, Christmas decorations and wooden carvings. I thought the Christmas decorations were a lot nicer here as they were more white and silver and seemed to reflected the chill in the air. ![Salzberg](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1598-1024x683.jpg) We paused to ask a shopkeeper for a lunch recommendation and we were really happy when we found ourselves in a sort of pub made up of shared tables. We both chose chicken schnitzel which is a typical dish. For some reason I'd assumed it was a kind of sausage but it's actually just flattened, breaded meat. Paired with beer of course. ![Schnitzel](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1601-1024x683.jpg) We got chatting to two Americans over lunch and they were keen to take the gondola up the mountain. The only issue was time. We raced there and managed to catch the last one up meaning we didn't have too long to play in the snow. If we missed the last one down it was a long walk!! It was well worth it. The views were incredible. I only wish we'd been able to stay up there to fully watch the sunset. ![Salzberg](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1660-1024x683.jpg)   ![Salzberg](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_8371-1024x768.jpg)![Salzberg](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1665-1024x683.jpg)     Afterwards we headed back to Munich. Charlie fancied a Chinese (very cultured!!) and we found this tiny one with a little old lady who was really excited to see us. She gave us amazing service and the food was delicious. Exactly what we needed as we were shattered!! ![Chinese ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1689-1024x683.jpg) Our last day. We got up early and found a cute little coffee shop for breakfast. Charlie, hater of coffee, even had a cappuccino. Then we took it slow with a walk around town, a few last beers at the Hofbrauhaus and then lunch with friends. I really wanted to go back to Tollwood which was near where we stayed so we managed to fit in a final mulled wine before heading off for our flight. ![Hofbrauhaus](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1719-1024x683.jpg) If you get a chance next year try and take a trip over to the German markets. It really gets you in the festive mood and it a great place to some different Christmas presents. ![Munich](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1586-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "I quite often watch or listen to TED talks when I'm eating or have a bit of spare time on my hands. Each is quite short which is good if you're in a bit of a breakfast rush before work or just want to distract yourself for a while. So far each one I've watched has inspired me in some way or another. I'll quite often pick out themes that interest me such as happiness or the arts but I'm going to try and push myself to watch and learn new things through them in 2016\\. Anyway, the reason for this post is because as I sat eating my breakfast this morning, surrounded by all the unpacking we have to do from Christmas, I was inspired. I was inspired to ignore the unpacking (very easy!) and take some time to write this post. It's so easy to get into the swing of normal things. How many of you find yourself doing the same thing - waking up, going to work, seeing some friends and coming home again to sleep then starting again the next morning. Week in week out. But have you ever asked yourself if you are happy with that? _Do you want to learn anything new? Do you want to meet new people to? Do you want to always go to the same bar or restaurant? Are you happy in your routine? Are you happy where you live and work?_ These are all hard questions and it seems like good timing, as people around the world pick their new year resolutions, I've decided mine. It can be as big or as small as I wish and I won't approach the end of January feeling like I've failed it already. I've decided that mine is simply to be happy. That's not saying that I'm not happy right now but it's an encouragement to do more of things that make me smile deep down as well as on the surface. I've had the most ups and downs in 2015 that I've ever had in my life but overall I've had an amazing year: I got married, bought a house and travelled quite a bit - **how am I going to top it in 2016? I'm going to surround myself with happiness.** I've gone a little off topic but why not watch the Ted Talk yourself and see what you take from it? It's by Scott Dinsmore and my favourite quote is:\n\n**\"Only thing that limits possibility is now imagination\" **\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/scott_dinsmore_how_to_find_work_you_love.html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

      "wordpressContent": "As a kid I always used to go to the small theatre near me to see a pantomime at Christmas. As I got older this became slightly different and now I find myself seeking out a weird and wonderful show to see around Christmas/ New Year. Last year we went to the Southbank to see Timber which was all around a family of lumberjacks from Quebec juggling axes and chainsaws. This year I heard about [La Soirée](http://www.la-soiree.com/) and knew we had to go. The description was everything I loved - cabaret, burlesque and circus. As we arrived we were greeted by the familiar sounds of \"roll up roll up\" coming from a strangely dressed man - it was a real circus! We got inside and looked around and I got even more excited for what was to come. The atmosphere was buzzing and the lighting around the stage was exactly how I had imagined. The stage itself was a small circle platform in the centre of the seats. We were positioned near the walkway for the performers to walk through. ![La Soirée](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1921-1024x683.jpg) My favourite act of the evening was the two English gents who ended up stripping down and holding each other up by various body parts; whilst smoking a pipe of course. These guys were ripped! They each came on by themselves too, one of them explained the physics of a bubble (who knew?!) in quite a philosophical way and the other coming on to pretty much pole dance. [caption id=\"attachment_1008\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"310\"]![La Soirée - English Gents](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/eg-310x470.jpg) Image credit: La Soirée[/caption] We could not stop laughing during the performance. From a juggling Freddie Mercury to Asher Treleaven doing 'diablo for the ladies' and reading out sections of erotic tales. There was various people swinging from hoops, dancing on a motorcycles and embarrassing the audience. Another highlight was Captain Frodo who managed to squeeze his body through two tennis racquets. As with all the artists in the show it wasn't just what they did but how they performed it and played to the audience. Frodo for example kept flicking out tiny pieces of silver in a 'ta-da' type fashion throughout his act. I don't want to spoil to much about the show but I would really recommend going along for a hilarious night out.

      "wordpressContent": "Now don't be worried ‘[Reasons To Stay Alive](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reasons-Stay-Alive-Matt-Haig/dp/1782115080)’ is a brilliant book by Matt Haig that I’ve just finished. It’s about depression and anxiety and this is why I think everyone should read it... One in five people suffer from depression at some point in their lives. You've probably already met people who have it without even realising. Even with depression, and other mental illnesses for that matter, being so widespread, they are still misunderstood and especially misrepresented in popular media and culture. One of the worst things I’ve ever heard was when an (ex) friend asked another friend who had just confided she was depressed: \"but can't you just be happy?\" Whether or not it was meant badly, it’s just about the most awful thing she could have responded with. Matt covers how to act around people suffering from depression as well as how to cope with it yourself. Depression is an illness; you can't just decide to be happy the same way you can't just decide to feel well again in the middle of the flu. More and more people are coming forward and asking for help with depression and knowing more about it and having more widespread acceptance, understanding and support WILL make a difference. Knowing that someone who understands is only a phone call away can give such peace of mind. Matt's book is about his personal journey through depression and what makes it so compelling is that he shares absolutely everything. From standing on the edge of a cliff, contemplating his sanity to being unable to buy milk at a corner shop because of his anxiety through to everything that picked him up again - every little up and down. His story is supplemented with medical knowledge, examples of others who have suffered and of course helpful tips. Having never really looked into mental illnesses before I hadn’t realised how much there is to learn and how many famous names have lived and still are living with depression. **Last year was the best year of my life.** I married my best friend, bought a house with him and travelled more than I ever have before. But it was also the most mentally straining year of my life. This year I'm chasing happiness and Matt's book has helped pushed me further towards this goal. One my favourite sections was where he listed every small thing that made him happy. I thought I'd do the same and share everything that puts a smile on my face (I wonder how many will match up to last year's [list](http://vikibell.com/happiness-is/)? _Sunsets, sunny days, waking up before an alarm, lie ins, good music, loud music, music to fit the mood, walks outside, Suffolk, escaping the city, exploring a new country. Photography, painting, being creative, brainstorming and coming up with crazy ideas that you will never actually do but they sound fun. Colours - bright. Seeing friends, laughter and laughing. Watching Charlie doing improv, Charlie, our wedding day, our honeymoon, painting a crazy table plan in the middle of the woods by throwing paint on it, making our day so creative and unique, hearing all the amazing feedback we had from it (best wedding ever was muttered a fair few times!)_ _The fizzy ones in pick n mix, steak, tomatoes, BBQ food cold beer, red wine, amaretto after a meal, long meals out, drinking Aspalls in the pub in Suffolk, sitting by the fire and watching a bonfire burn. The sea, swimming, waterfalls and giant lakes that you can't even see the other side of. Surprises and random acts of kindness. Kittens, Charlie's cats coming for a cuddle oh and cuddles & kisses. People reading my blog, compliments being given and received, positive thoughts and when you do something no one believed you could do. Shooting stars, a full moon casting shadows. My friends doing exciting things. Realising it's a Sunday when you thought it was a Monday. Victoria station being shut and having to walk from Green Park to work and appreciating it takes me right past Buckingham Palace. Living in London, being able to get anywhere easily, walking home instead of getting public transport. And taking time to pause and appreciate everyone and everything around me._ As I said, I think everyong should read this book, but if you're looking to learn more about it then you can pop over to [Matt's blog](http://www.matthaig.com/reasons-to-stay-alive/). But for now …. **What's on your happy list?** ![Viki](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0693-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Since I moved to London four years ago my nights out in Essex have dramatically decreased. So when a friend suggested a night out I thought, why not? I hadn’t heard the best things about nights in Basildon (who has?) but I’ll try anything once.\n\n![Basildon](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_8928.jpg)\n\nAfter pizza and drinks we headed to Unit 7 in the retail park. It lived up to expectations with overly strict security, girls cat fighting and 'lads' prowling the dance floor. It wasn't our usual scene but we were there so made it into a good night ... With a lot of booze.\n\n![Basildon](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_0006.jpg)\n\nI love sleepovers so when I woke up the next morning<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"></span> Charlie and I became those annoying early risers that go around waking everyone up - fun! After a few hangover cures (pizza and a movie) we decided to take a trip to Southend for donuts and arcade games and relive our childhood.\n\nWe then found out that we had last minute tickets to the Vaults that evening and their Mardi Gras party. This was my favourite part of the weekend because, well GLITTER!! Completely unprepared we jumped on the train back to London and began glittering ourselves up.\n\n![Mardi Gras](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_8982.jpg)\n\nI had only heard about The Vaults recently but knew it was somewhere I wanted to go. Positioned in the old tunnels by Waterloo I can only imagine the history there. To get there we turned down a back ally covered with graffiti and smelling a little funky. We watched some guys adding some fresh paint to the walls before heading inside. This was more like a party then a club or a bar.\n\n![Mardi Gras](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_9039.jpg) To kick off the night there was a procession of musicians and dancers through the venue (and apparently along the south bank). Then we started dancing and by dancing I mean serious dancing - people were not holding back and there were even some semi-pro looking spins going on. The energy in the room was incredible and that wasn't down to the coffee tequila shots we were drinking!![Mardi Gras](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_8972-1.jpg)\n\nAs the night wore on I got a little bit carried away with the glitter. I even managed to begin a trading session where I’d earn Mardi Gras beads for sprinkling glitter on people's faces. The pictures will explain how carried away I got...\n\n![Mardi Gras](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_9003.jpg) ![Mardi Gras](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_9047.jpg)That was us at 3am. I like to think we're still smiling because of the amount of glitter we're wearing. I love it when a weekend that turns into something after having no plans to begin with. And of course I love it when glitter is involved, even if I’ll spend the next few months finding it all over my house.",

      "wordpressContent": "I only starting hearing about immersive theatre in the past year or so but I was super keen to try it out. When I finally got my hands on some tickets to a [CoLab](http://www.colabtheatre.co.uk/) performance of The Crooks I was pretty excited. I wasn't too sure what to expect. We were told to _don your flat caps and join us in an episodic tumble down the sink as we go undercover into London’s VHS tinted criminal underworld. Meet the Don and his trouble and strife whilst helping his sigh associates maintain the inner mechanics of London’s Cockney Cartel. _ Charlie and I went along to London Bridge and found a huddle of people standing around outside an old rug factory. It looked dark inside and I wasn't 100% certain we'd gone to the right place until a pretty rough looking individual popped out asking who we were. We muttered a code word and were let in underneath the rusty shutters of the garage and into the middle of police undercover operation on The Don. ![Immersive theatre](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_9274.jpg) I was a bit worried about seeming silly when I first got inside but I was soon joining in the chants and taking daring risks to infiltrate the gang. You just have to let yourself go and pretend that you're in a real life situation. It's like being in a video game or being involved in [improv](http://vikibell.com/improv-night-at-the-miller/). If I spill the beans on what happened inside I'm sure The Don will hunt me down. All you need know is that we infiltrated his mob, came close to being shot, saw fights break out and were offered countless amounts of drugs and booze from the gang members. It was really fun. I'd love to go to more immersive theatre so if you have any recommendations just give me a shout! ![Immersive theatre](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CROOKSIMAGE-1_edited-1.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">I'm stood on the tube beginning this blog post after overhearing a conversation I didn't want to hear. No doubt I'll come back to it again and again before deciding whether to publish it. If you're reading this then I decided to publish it anyway.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A group of men have just got off at Euston after spending the past two stops discussing whether to grab my ass (I choose the word ass because that's how they were describing it and that's how they made me feel - like I have an ass that's screaming to be grabbed, a piece of meat that you can reach out and pinch). Luckily they decided against it because they assumed I would slap them. If they hadn't, I hope that I would have been able to stand up to them but I doubt I would have slapped them, I'm not that sort of person. Either way I'm likely to have just felt embarrassed for the rest of the journey. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This isn't a rant. Okay it is a bit and I was about to say that I can't believe men still make remarks like that but I can. Men constantly need to prove themselves to each other to be the toughest, the most desired by women - the king of the pack I suppose. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A day after beginning this post I was in a pub in Angel when I heard two guys talking together. The things they were saying made me instantly judge them and their partners. Overhearing quotes like these in the pub has become so natural that I almost didn't pick up on them. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">_Guy A: \"How do you feel about your missus? Do you wanna fuck other women? Well of course you do but does she know?_\" </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A little while later... </span>\n\n_<span class=\"s1\">Guy A: \"I cheated on Sandy but I couldn't look her in the face. I didn't do it again but I think about it. That isn't cheating is it?\"</span>_\n\n_<span class=\"s1\">Guy B: \"Course it isn't. You can feel it and look at it, have a little wank here and there.\"</span>_\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I felt out of place. I didn't want to be near conversations like that. I expect both men would have been full of niceties in front of their partners but I can't help but feel that they are being cheated by having them speak about them like that (not to mention that actual cheating). </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Guys can be just as bitchy as girls too. When I was out the other week one of my guy friends was asked if I was his 'bird' (I hate that term) to save me getting hit on he answered yes. The guy then informed him that he was punching above his weight. What?! Why is there a need to be so hurtful and aggressive to someone you've only just met. When is that acceptable behaviour?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I'm not sure of the point of this post other than to get all that off my chest. I'm just tired of hearing sexual comments being made or being stared at by creepy men on the tube. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I know not every male speaks or acts those ways towards people and I haven't mentioned all the times girls have been just as bad or times when guys have been lovely. The people I encountered recently and the conversations I've heard have just made me a little more disappointed in humans but I'm sure there will be the times when my faith is restored again soon. </span>\n\nThat got a little negative so here's an image which makes me smile to bring you back into positive thoughts...\n\n![Pigs](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_3579.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "From one peek at my Instagram you'll know that I shoot off to Suffolk at any chance I can get and I've finally listed out a few of my favourite things to do around Thorpeness. As much as I love London you can't beat a weekend in the countryside. Our house is based just outside of village down a long dirt track. It's called The Shellpits as there used to be big pits where people would gather fossil remains. The whole area was used heavily in the war and you can still see the foundations of the WWII anti aircrafts guns on the field outside. All the owners of the seven cottages get on really well and there's a big community spirit with BBQs during the summer and drinks around the fire in the winter. The whole of Thorepness is extremely welcoming and friendly. I've been told snippets of history about Thorepness over the years so I decided to research it a bit more for this post. Did you know it was named 'Weirdest Village in England' by 'Bizarre' magazine in 2003? The village used to be a fishing hamlet but was bought by a rich Scottish barrister, Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie, in 1910 who turned it into his fantasy holiday village. He built the golf course, country club, swimming pool and holiday homes so his friends and colleagues could visit during the summer. A lot of the Ogilvie family still live or visit Thorpeness too. Whenever I go up there's a few things I like to do and a few times of year I like to be there so here's my _9 Things To Do Around Thorpeness_. If you ever get a chance to visit the area you'll know where to find me and what to do! **Aldeburgh** ![Moonlight](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/v2IMG_5404.jpg) Fish and chips is a must and you'll see how popular it is by the queues. In the summer you'll have to wait for an hour or so but it's well worth it. If the fish was any fresher it would still be swimming. Once you've got your fish and chips head over to the stone beach and enjoy it whilst overlooking the sea. Don't worry the seagulls stay back! ![Aldeburgh beach](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/v2IMG_3193.jpg) While you're in Aldeburgh have a look around the shops. There isn't a lot but you're always bound to find some goodies especially from the Alde or the Adnams shop. **The Dolphin** ![The Dolphin](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_5675.jpg) I can't remember a time that I've been to Suffolk without going to The Dolphin for at least one cheeky pint. It's pretty much in the central of Thorpeness so you can't miss it. It's the place where we went for dinner after Charlie proposed, where we sang carols at Christmas, where we've had countless summer hog roasts and it's somewhere where the staff always greet you with a smile. If we are up by ourselves in the winter we like getting a board game and spending our afternoons by the fire in there or in the summer we chill in the garden outside. For us an evening trip to the pub always ends with a walk back through the fields navigating our way by the moonlight. For someone who has always lived around light pollution I still get amazed at the moon shadows. **The Meare** ![The Meare](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0064-1.jpg) The Meare was hand dug and is a boating lake dotted with little islands each names in the theme of Peter Pan. This was Ogilvie’s homage to his friend J.M. Barrie’s now classic novel. In the summer there's the _Thorpeness Regatta_ which is where children's boat races take place. On the Friday night the punts are decorated and paraded around the Meare before a big fireworks display. **The beach** ![Thorpeness Beach](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_8610.jpg) People are always heading to the beach in the summer despite the cold North Sea and the unreliable British weather. It's the perfect thing to sweep away the cob webs or banish the hangover from one too many pints of Aspalls. Of course I managed to fit in a dip in the sea on my wedding day! ![Thorpeness Beach](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_6050.jpg) **Take a walk** It's only in the recent years that I've started to really enjoy walking but in Suffolk there's so many different places you can explore. During a chilly January day we've walked to Dunwich for lunch, it took us four hours to get there and four hours back (after a few beers) but it was worth the day trip. I slowed us down quite a lot taking photos but the scenery is amazing. You can even see some of the anti-tank cubes dating back to the war. ![Minsmere](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/v2IMG_0073.jpg) If you don't fancy such a long walk you can go across Minsmere which is a bird reserve and have a drink in the Eels Foot - yes all walks are navigated by the pubs (have you never been to the countryside?) There are loads of walk you can do from wherever you're staying so have a look at [Walking in Suffolk](http://www.walkinginsuffolk.co.uk/saxmundham.php) for some routes. ![Dunwich](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0241.jpg) **Visit Snape Maltings.** On certain Saturday's there's a farmers market with the best cheese straws alongside other goodies like local pate and cheeses. During a normal day Snape has a selection of shops selling local foods and niche home bits and bobs alongside local artwork and antiques. Of course there is also the famous music hall there too. After a nose around the shops I'd recommend taking a walk alongside the river Alde or having a cheeky pint of Adnams in The Plough & Sail pub. To see what else is on visit their [website](http://www.snapemaltings.co.uk/). ![Snape Maltings](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/v2IMG_7572.jpg) **Glemham Hall** [Glemham hall](http://www.glemhamhall.co.uk/) was where Charlie and I got married and I've been meaning to go back there for one of their events. They have loads of things on all year round from their Folk East festival to various plays and of course weddings! We drive past it on our way up and always point it out. In the summer it's easy to spot as there's a dead tree which gets decorated. Last year it had bikes hanging from it. The owners are very into art which you'll see from a walk around their sculpture garden. ![Glemham Hall](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/v21060.1208.jpg) **Aldeburgh Carnival** Each year in August there's the [Aldebugh Carnival](http://www.aldeburghcarnival.com/). This is also around the time of the Thorpeness Regatta. The Monday of carnival week is when there's a big procession through Aldeburgh with floats and plenty of fancy dress. Each year there's an overarching theme, this year's is 'circus comes to town'. We used to go up each year when we were younger and camp out in Charlie's garden. The Monday is still a big event taking us back to our childhood by drinking on the beach in front of the pub and stumbling home in the dark. It's also the weekend the [Wood Party](http://vikibell.com/the-wood-party/) falls on so we're usually doing something exciting around then. ![Aldeburgh Carnival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SNV39032.jpg) **Thorpefest** For the past few years there's been a music festival on Aldeburgh. We stumbled across it by accident when it was soul themed and last year it was music through the decades. This year it's coming to Thorpeness so it might be a little different but I'm sure it will still be great! ![Thorpefest](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_5838.jpg) There's quite a few things you can do to explore the area. You also make your own fun there whether that's taking a walk along the beach or curling up with a good book in front of the fire. It's the perfect place to escape the buzz of the city. Enjoy! ![Aspall](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/v2IMG_7195.jpg)",

I love that they've added in GIFs - who doesn't love a GIF?   Anyway, I've been having a bit of a dig around in my Twitter history to looking back at my account and I've found a few great and 'slightly strange' tweets I've sent. Time to share! My degree was in Art and Design and as part of that we did a module around marketing ourselves so I set up my Twitter account. Since October 2010 I've sent over 6,400 tweets and learnt a lot. Judging from my first tweet I had no idea what I was doing but decided to jump straight in at the deep-end.\n\n> Is priming a canvas, what will I do with it next?\n> \n> — Viki Bell (@Vikiibell) [October 29, 2010](https://twitter.com/Vikiibell/status/29109653595)\n\n  I never did find out what I did with it and years on I'm still sending pointless tweets. \n\n> [#Pointlesstweet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pointlesstweet?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/LyHDCCGlZR](http://t.co/LyHDCCGlZR) — Viki Bell (@Vikiibell) [February 20, 2015](https://twitter.com/Vikiibell/status/568776174941409280)\n\nBut sometimes, occasionally, I tweet a real gem. Self-five!\n\n> Every time I walk through Victoria station in the morning it's like the stampede scene in the Lion King.

I love the fact I can shout out to my followers and random people can just interact with what I've said.\n\n> I'M GETTING MARRIED TODAY!!! But first for a swim in the sea [#suffolk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/suffolk?src=hash)[#wedding](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wedding?src=hash)[#summer](https://twitter.com/hashtag/summer?src=hash)[pic.twitter.com/UvieTFDRoo](http://t.co/UvieTFDRoo) — Viki Bell (@Vikiibell) [July 18, 2015](https://twitter.com/Vikiibell/status/622313587156123648)\n\nI didn't just look back at my tweets. I've gone further and looked back specifically at my last year's activity where I sent a total of 1,247 tweets and potentially reached 1.7 million people - wow! I also had a look at some of my most used words. I'd guessed that these would include blog, coffee, wedding, and wine but I was surprised to see quite a few names in there too. Shoutout to [Emma Inks](https://twitter.com/Emma_Inks) who I seem to mention a lot! ![wordcloud](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wordcloud.png) I've been more active on Twitter in the past year or so as I've begun blogging properly and making friends through it. I love how fast paced it is and how easy it is to keep up with everything going on there - something which could be lost with the increased character limits. I've met some amazing and inspiring people through both Twitter and my blog; it's a little corner of the internet I can be myself and send silly messages if I want to.\n\n> SO EXCITED for [#Marrakech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Marrakech?src=hash) this weekend with [@ellielowe](https://twitter.com/ellielowe) ☀️ any recommendations let me know!

It was a great place to share my news and updates, read other wedding stories and find inspiration. I especially LOVE this tweet from my bridesmaid who's since got engaged and is getting married this year!\n\n> Proud winner of the bouquet. It's not that I'm desperate to get married next, I just can't stand losing at catch.

      "wordpressContent": "The next place on my travel list was Marrakech so with a few days of holiday to use up I jumped on a place with my friend Ellie and headed there for a long weekend. Our pre-trip research had us a bit worried about our clothes and the way we might be treated there, I had read a lot of reviews saying that men will pester you and women will spit at you. Ignore that! It wasn't like that at all and we had nothing to be worried about. As a westerner you will be glanced at and a few comments might be made but as long as you don't encourage it then it's fine. Marrakech was great for a short break and we had a good balance of busy and relaxing so I thought I'd share my recommendations with you.\n\n# **Stay in a Riad**\n\nThere are plenty of Riads around and it gives you a more traditional feel compared to the usual hotel. These are quite small so you'll get to know the staff well as they share their tips of what to do and see. We stayed in Riad Tilila which was perfect. Our room was exactly what we needed especially as we weren't planning on spending any time in there and we were given a local phone just in case we got lost! There was also the roof terrace so we could have our breakfast in the sunshine. One evening we ended up watching the sunset up there with a few beers. My only recommendation would be to request a not downstairs room as we literally opened our door and were in the lounge. It didn't bother us but might do someone looking for a bit more privacy. ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2581.jpg)\n\n# Jardin Majorelle\n\nAfter an early flight we wanted to have a chilled first day and decided to explore the Jardin Majorelle which we'd heard lots about. Once inside the walls of the garden it was a complete contrast to the busy streets of Marrakech. When we first got there Ellie and I just wandered around in amazement, it was exactly what we needed - somewhere calm and peaceful. And blue. I LOVED the blue! ![Jardin Majorelle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2298.jpg)   The garden was created by the artist, Jacques Majorelle and was a side project to his painting. He would travel the world and bring back exotic and rare species of cacti, bamboo and palm trees. After Majorelle fell into money troubles and died the garden faced ruin and was due to be sold to make way for a hotel. Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé brought the garden back to life after being inspired by its beauty. They lived there for a while and you can find a memorial to Yves Saint Laurent inside the garden. I could really feel an artist touch in the garden, there was something special there that made me ignore the tourists snapping photos and enjoy atmosphere. We walked around twice making sure to take everything in. One side is bamboo but my favourite section was the cactus plants - we picked our cactus alter-egos. ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_0072.jpg)\n\n# **Haggle with the souks**\n\nYou can't go to Marrakech without haggling down the souks. I loved getting lost in the market and discovering everything in there. Like most markets a lot of the stuff is similar stall to stall but if you keep walking around you'll see different areas. One area reminded me of Romford market as it was selling a load of underwear and baby clothes reminding me of my Sundays at the market with nan. We got a little lost and ended up in the leather section, there were bags everywhere! Here I found the perfect birthday present for my brother; I haggled a bit but didn't get it down quite enough so moved onto the next stall. I found a pretty much similar if not better bag and got that for a the price I was willing to pay. Simple! As long as you haggle with a smile on your face and don't get offended if they don't go down then it's fine. The price the souks go in with is always higher than they expect you to pay so don't get shocked at the first price. ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_9560.jpg) You'll also see a lot of spice shops around. After buying the bag the man showed us into his friends stall where we met Ayoub who gave us a bit of a tour of his spices. He was bragging about the time Jamie Oliver came in to pick up a few bits and we ended up coming out of there with some Moroccan mint and jasmine tea. Marrakech is famous for its rugs as well. These won't be super cheap but they will be a bargain compared to what you'd spend in the UK. Make sure you check the quality as well as it differs stall to stall. I managed to find one I loved which is really good quality. Although I liked the design of my second favourite it wouldn't last nearly as long. Again you can haggle on these but don't be too cheeky; remember the amount of work that goes into making them. ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2609.jpg)\n\n# Mojitos in nomad\n\nWhen you need a break from the Souks head to the Nomad bar and have a few mojitos on the rooftops. These might just be the best mojitos I've ever had. They do great food too which I'll go into on my next post. ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2525.jpg)\n\n# Ouzoud waterfall\n\nWe wanted to do one day trip during our stay and didn't fancy anything too 'touristy'. Imad at our Riad recommended going to see the Ouzoud waterfall, so we did. We headed out early, driving north, east and towards the town of Ouzoud. It was really nice to be out of the city and seeing more of Morocco. Like most group day trips it does depend on the people you're with and our trip was made by the Welsh group who turned up in tiny shorts, bikinis and flip flops - they'd been told that they were in for a day sunbathing and swimming. They saw a funny side to things when they realised we were hiking to the bottom of the waterfall and back up and we all got on well. ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2358.jpg) When you get to the pool of the waterfall you can go on these little rafts across the water. This was one of my favourite parts as the local rowing us decided to take us completely into the spray whilst laughing his head off. We all had no idea what he was doing but I couldn't stop laughing either. ![Ouzoud waterfall](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_0046-1.jpg) ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2398.jpg) Also, there were monkeys! ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2412.jpg)\n\n# **Bahia palace**\n\nThere's two palaces in Marrakech and as we hadn't researched either we picked one at random; as we arrived we realised that it was the venue for the biennale so we had a nice walk around the artworks. My favourite part was this courtyard in the sunshine - it's so symmetrical! ![Bahia Palace](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2476.jpg) You don't need very long in Marrakech. We arrived Friday morning and left Monday evening and that was perfect. If we'd stayed for a day longer I think we would have done a camping trip in the Atlas mountains. Don't be put off by a few reviews saying it's unsafe. As long as you're confident walking down the street and you're aware then you'll be fine! Go and get lost in the streets and and explore Marrakech. ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2532.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "I always like to know where to eat on holiday especially when it's a short break. Knowing some of the good places can really make a holiday for me. Unfortunately, I had managed to forget I'd booked our Marrakech trip until a few days before so hadn't had time to research anything - TripAdvisor to the rescue! Not only can you search by location and price, the app has a handy little feature so you can put a 'with alcohol' filter on the restaurants, something I'm not ashamed to say we used! After filtering by location, booze and price I think we found some of the top places to eat so here they are....\n\n# Le Comptoir Du Pacha\n\nWe found this during a speedy search on our first might and chose it because the food looked good, it was near to our Riad and it was cheap- exactly what we wanted after an early start. Friendly staff, good food and good atmosphere in an typical Moroccan layout. We stuck to the set menu and had a selection of meat and vegetables rolls to start followed by steak and lemon meringue pie.  I was tired so excuse the bad lighting and iPhone photos! ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_9334.jpg) ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_9342.jpg)\n\n# Breakfast in the Riad\n\nWe took full advantage of our riad breakfasts and had them sitting on the roof in the morning sunshine. Freshly squeezed orange juice is something that you'll hear a lot about in Marrakech and I can tell you with good authority that it is A M A Z I N G! Each breakfast was a carb overload with baskets of fresh bread, pastries and yogurts. My favourite bit was our orange and chocolate pancakes. ![Riad](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_9583.jpg)\n\n# Nomad\n\nIf you go to Marrakech you'll hear about Nomad. It kind of put me off as I got the impression it was quite touristy but after being I see that it both was and wasn't. It was just quite a nice place to eat or have a drink. There is two roof terraces as well as indoor eating which all looks quite fancy. We went during the day but I get the feeling you'll need a reservation if you come at night. ![Nomad](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_9555.jpg) Once settled in the sunshine we ordered a few mojitos and, as I mentioned in my previous [post](http://vikibell.com/six-things-to-do-in-marrakech-in-four-days/), I swear they're some of the best mojitos I've had in my life. We ended up going for lunch on two days here as the staff were so friendly and the food so good. The first day we shared courgette fritters and bread and dips. The second time we both ordered the nomad burger. We had seen it the day before and got a bit of food envy and rightly so! It was all soooo good.![Nomad](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_9557.jpg) ![Nomad](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_9589.jpg)\n\n# Cafe arabe\n\nWe went here on our second night. Recommended by TripAdvisor and it was on a Marrakech [app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marrakech-riad-travel-guide/id489129273?mt=8) that I'd downloaded. As we headed out the door Imad, who worked in our Riad, told us he used to work there so we knew we were in good hands. The restaurant was tiny and on the bottom floor of another Riad. The waiter was really friendly and kept joking about my food - especially funny as the menu was all on French so I had no idea what Ellie had ordered for me. We shared homous and breads and then I ended up with was a vegetarian pasta in a creamy sauce which was super tasty! ![Marrakech](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_9538.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "I love jewellery. I love finding weird and wonderful rings and bracelets in various markets around the world. At some point I decided that I wanted to try out making some myself, so, after a little research, I signed myself up to Alexandra's jewellery course in Hatton Garden. If you're going to learn about jewellery you may as well learn about it in the jewellery centre of London! One of the reasons I chose this course over the others was because it wasn't just a beginners course. There were only five of us and three had been to quite a few of the courses before and were working on their pieces in their spare time. This meant we were able to see the process of more intricate pieces being made. ![IMG_7817](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7817.jpg) The course ran for ten weeks every Wednesday and each week I learnt something new. Throughout the ten classes I made two rings and a necklace each designed (or slightly made up on the spot) by me. I learn how to solder, stone setting, resizing and reshaping pieces, polishing and even twisting the metal (which you can see on my necklace). ![IMG_7997](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7997.jpg) The first thing I made was the ring. It was here that I learnt about stone setting and all the measurements which need to be calculated in the process. The stone is only held in by the metal which I physically forced down on top of it. The stone was bought from one of the shops in Hatton Garden and was surprisingly the same stone as the one in my necklace which I'd picked up in Florence. ![jewellery](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7252.jpg) My favourite piece is the chunky silver ring I made. We were being taught about carving and given a lump of wax to experiment with. After shaving various bits off and carving into it with a few different tools, we sent it to the casters who set it in silver. When it arrived back I wasn't too sure I liked it; it just looked like a big silver lump and I was aiming for something that looked quite natural and a bit like a rock. I decided to fix it by oxidising it to create a black effect. Then I polished up random bits using two different dremel (drill) parts to give it different amounts of shine. Finally, I had a proper look at what I'd made and it's safe to say I like it - I wear it pretty much everyday now. ![jewellery](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_8088.jpg) [Alexandra's course](http://centralschoolofjewellery.com/) was brilliant for any beginner or even if you know a few things about jewellery making. It's structured in such a way that, unlike other courses, you can decide exactly what you want to make - if you don't want to make a ring then that's fine, make something else. She'll help you plan out your end designs, tell you the best places to get materials and help you when you inevitably mess something up.",

      "postSlug": "survive-zombie-apocalypse",
      "postDate": "2016-04-26 11:05:41",
      "wordpressContent": "One of the questions I keep asking at the moment is _what would you do if there was suddenly a zombie outbreak_. Okay, I realise that sounds really really odd but everyone's answers are different and it's actually quite interesting. I thought I'd share my (untested!) tips of how to survive and I've broken it down for each place I might be when the outbreak begins.\n\n# If you're in London / a city when all hell breaks loose.\n\nSee if you can escape and get out of the city. Take food and water in a backpack and try to get out on bike. Head to countryside. Now skip to the countryside section. If there is absolutely no way out and you're likely to get knocked down by a bicycle riding fool with a backpack, then stay put. Get chatting to your neighbours and pick the highest flat to stay in and make a den. Knock down/ block any stairs so the zombies can't get up, but ensure you have an escape route such as a low roof to jump out onto or a ladder. Ration your food and water. When running water inevitably runs out you'll need to look for more. Have a think about the toilet situation, you might need to poop out the window and stuff so get friendly with your neighbours! Teach each other new skills like fire building, hunting etc. Hopefully you'll be able to find a way into the countryside later.\n\n# You're in a town that's about an hour out of the city.\n\nOkay this is better. Think about getting out and heading to the countryside. Plan a few different routes or places to go and get there fast before word spreads. Take rations and spare petrol etc. If you can't leave, then work out how to secure your house and, as above, think about escape routes etc. Stock up on food, water, candles and weapons. If you have a car then think about getting more petrol so you can travel but store it somewhere separate so you'll still have petrol to use on another car if yours gets stolen. Also, if there is any kind of wild animals like deer in the parks then you might want to think about hunting them.   If you're in a town then hopefully the zombie plague won't spread as quickly as if you were in the city so you have more time to thing about these things.\n\n# You're in the countryside.\n\nOkay this would be the dream situation. I'm imagining that I'm in Suffolk but most countryside places would be okay/ similar. Food and water is sorted. The house is a holiday home so it's always stocked with tins of food. There are a load of old cooking books showing you how to cook things like rabbit for when it's later down the line - just thing about offering food to neighbours as you might need their help at some point! For the water, we can dig down into the old well and use that again. As a longterm goal you'll need to think about getting to a farmland for vegetables etc. and planting your own. In the countryside you have a little longer until the infection spreads so take the time to prepare. Use the last of the Internet to watch YouTube videos which will help you long term. Maybe try some around arrow making, wall building and farming. Secure the property. If zombie films are anything to go on then the nighttime is the scariest part so make sure you're prepared. Board up windows and build a wall around your property if you can. Luckily we have a big ditch that used to be shell pits outside the house so that would pretty much be our moat! You should also draw up a night watch rota to make sure no zombies break this barrier. Welcome people into your zombie safe haven but be aware of their strengths and weaknesses. Give the weak people easy and familiar tasks to do like cooking or tidying up the house whilst the stronger ones build things and hunt. Then finally **have fun and try not to die.** If the zombie plague has spread across the world then there isn't a lot of hope unless a cure has already been found so you may as well try to stay alive for as long as you can but have a bit of fun whilst doing so. Good luck! ![Zombie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/g.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "One of our wedding presents was vouchers for a [Sunday jazz cruise](http://www.bateauxlondon.com/cruises/sunday-lunch-jazz-cruises/). We wanted to wait until it was a bit warm before booking so picked a random weekend in May to use them. It just so happened that the random weekend in May was when London hit 26 degrees. Win! ![IMG_2887](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2887-1024x674.jpg) We headed to embankment pier and were shown onto the boat, Symphony, and to our table by some very happy waiters. We must have been the youngest couple on there. Other people were celebrating grandparents birthdays or were out for lunch with other 'adult aged' couples. As a cruise down the Thames it does lend itself to be a tourist trap but, luckily it wasn't. Everyone seemed really happy to be there and there was a lovely atmosphere. The waiters took our food and drink order. We chose fizz of course - this was a wedding present after all! ![Jazz boat cruise](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0349-e1464618057824-1024x844.jpg) We started off up the Thames and went past the big MI6 building and past the bridges I cross during my walks at work. We then spun around and headed back down past the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye and as far as Canary Wharf. As we drifted along a jazz band started playing. Unfortunately, we were in the back of the boat meaning we couldn't watch them which was a shame. The sax and singer popped in twice to prove that they existed though. We started with the ham hock terrine which was really good. The pickle was super tasty; something I wouldn't have put with it myself but the flavours worked really well. ![ham hock](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ham-hock-1024x746.jpg) Next I had the salmon with almond crust and green beans. ![Salmon dish](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2841-1024x683.jpg \"Salmon dish\") Charlie chose the stuffed chicken supreme. As it was so warm outside I thought it might have been a bit heavy but it was just right. ![Roast chicken with carrots and potato ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2838-1024x667.jpg) We had a bit of an outside moment after that. It was so sunny and warm that I could have sat out there all day. ![Jazz boat cruise](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0350-1024x683.jpg) ![London Eye](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2837-1024x683.jpg) Then it was time for dessert - red velvet brownie, vanilla ice cream and a passion fruit coulis. I'm still not convinced by the red velvet craze but this dessert was really good especially the passion fruit coulis. ![Red velvet brownie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2875-1-1024x683.jpg) We'd ordered a bottle of white at some point and it didn't drop the standard. I'd expected the prices to be extortionate with substandard wine but that wasn't the case. With the trip coming to a close, we headed back to the docks with our bellies full and silly grins on our faces. The jazz cruise was the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon!",

      "wordpressContent": "I'd been into the bar at [Duck and Waffle](https://duckandwaffle.com/) ages ago but never actually eaten there. That all changed on Thursday evening. After work a group of us headed across to Liverpool Street in time for our reservation- the central line at rush hour is just wonderful isn't it?! We arrived at the Heron Tower and were escorted into the lift which shot us up to the 42nd floor and showed us the amazing view over London. I spent quite a while trying to see if I could spot the Arsenal stadium and my house before realising that I was looking in the completely wrong direction. ![Duck and Waffle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0487-1024x1024.jpg) We started off with a few of [Rich Woods](https://twitter.com/the_cocktailguy)' 'eat your greens' cocktails. I had Eden which was a concoction of Bombay Sapphire gin, bay leaf, IPA reduction, beetroot paint. Yes, I did choose it because it had paint in it. Everyone else went for the Pina-Kale-Ada which involved Bacardi Superior rum, pineapple sherbet, kale. We also had a few bar snacks, the bread came with violet artichoke in - I don't even like artichoke normally but it was SO good! ![Cocktail](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0482-1024x1024.jpg) After the drinks we headed to our table where a glass of fizz was waiting for us from Rich. Then waiter came over to explain how the menu worked. Duck and Waffle is a 'playful take on traditional British cuisine with broad European influences emphasizing local, rustic, seasonal and sustainable ingredients.' My kind of food! I usually find it difficult to pick out the one specific dish I fancy on the menu so when I found out that all the dishes are meant to be shared, I was particularly happy. We picked our favourites and ordered a big selection.\n\n<div>First to arrive was the spiced ox cheek donut with apricot jam and smoked paprika. I don't think I've ever had ox cheek before and it looked very peculiar to cut into but tasted so good. It was very rich so you don't need a lot of it.</div>\n\n<div> ![Duck and Waffle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0489-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>The rest of the starters arrived as we were digging into the donut. We had picked seared octopus with fennel, asparagus with poached Arlington white hen's egg, hassleback potatoes with confit duck egg yolk, and baked haddock with lobster cream. I'm not going to describe all of it because I don't think I can come up with enough adjectives to describe YUMMY!</div>\n\n<div>![Duck and Waffle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0491-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>We couldn't come all this way without having the duck and waffle which of course was amazing. I don't even like waffles normally but all the flavours complimented each other so well that I really enjoyed it.</div>\n\n<div>![Duck and Waffle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0497-1-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>We had also ordered the steak which I think was my joint favourite part of the entire meal (joint with the duck and waffle of course). This wasn't just any steak, it was a 38 day aged 500G Angus bone-in rib-eye with roasted crispy cabbage, and caper and bacon brown butter. As it was to share we had ordered it medium, as opposed to my usual blue and still mooing request. It was so tasty that I really didn't care how cooked it was, there was just so much flavour. The cabbage and capers and bacon butter again paired with the tastes perfectly.</div>\n\n<div>With main course complete it was onto dessert. Although we'd had a lot of food we each managed to squeeze it in, even if we did share. I went for the baked Alaska - lemon is my go to dessert seeing as I'm not a big fan of cake or chocolate. It was so pretty!! The others went for a mix of the brownie and the Torrejas with maple caramel apples and cinnamon ice cream - it was was big enough to share between all of us let along just two!</div>\n\n<div>![Duck and Waffle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0505-1024x765.jpg) ![Duck and Waffle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0501-1024x839.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>We headed back into the bar to finish our drinks, where our waiter had set us up a table. The music had been turned up at the atmosphere changed as the sun had set. We'd had a wonderful evening, the food, wine and service was all perfect and I'd love to go back up there sometime. ![Duck and Waffle](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0494-1024x768.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "Decorating wasn't a big priority when we moved into out flat in March last year, what with planning a wedding and a whole bunch of celebrations for the rest of the year. We'd originally planned quite a few changes to the layout but seeing as we haven't won the lottery, we decided to be happy with what we have and decorate it instead. The lady who lived there before hadn't done a lot so it all needed freshening up and become more _us_.\n\n<div>We've just finished our lounge, the first room in our challenge. It went from all being an off white to a mixture of white, dark grey and a light blue/ grey.</div>\n\n<div>![Decorating ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2570-e1464620028830-768x1024.jpeg)</div>\n\n<div>We're still planning some shelving units to go in the spaces either side of the fireplace which Charlie has designed. He's either going to build them or we'll find someone to do it for us.</div>\n\n<div>We ran into a few hurdles of course. We took off the existing shelves which ripped into the walls meaning we had to re-lining paper them. The same went for the chimney breast which had this horrible chip board wallpaper on which was all the rage in the 90s?! As we peeled it off the walls were still sticky underneath meaning we had to leave them to dry out a little after scraping everything off. We also has to steam the rest of the wallpaper off which caused my beautifully painted ceiling to bubble! Luckily these went away overnight.</div>\n\n<div>The second hurdle was actually lining the walls. We watched a few YouTube clips and got cracking. It's true that practice makes perfect as our first few pieces had a few more air bubbles in than the last. These air bubbles (and new ones) all came to the surface when I gave it the first coat of paint. I panicked. It looked awful! A quick call to grandpa though as we were sorted. He advised leaving the walls to dry as the air bubbles would disappear. Like magic they were gone the next day!</div>\n\n<div>![Viki Painting/ Decorating ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_9909-576x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>The third hurdle was completely self inflicted by the deign we wanted. I've always been a messy painter but this time I had to paint completely straight, neat lines against each other. It wasn't as difficult as I imagined and after watching a few YouTube videos I was fine.</div>\n\n<div>For our first attempt at fully decorating a room I think it went pretty well. Now onto the kitchen! ![Decorated lounge](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0549-1024x768.jpg)</div>",

I'm looking into my crystal ball to see what will make me happy this month.\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Improv course </span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I'm starting an improv course tomorrow which will run for eight weeks. I found out about improv at a start up night where people confessed their biggest fails. A comedian spoke about how she was on stage in front of hundreds of people and got heckled. She told them to \"strap in for the ride\" and kept her set going, proving to herself that she could do the show. She recommended a course which Charlie signing up for</span><span class=\"s1\"> immediately afterwards. Since then we've've been to various [nights](http://admin.vikibell.com/improv-night-at-the-miller/) at The Miller and I'm always sat in the audience shouting random suggestions for [Supercoth](http://supercouth.co.uk/) (Charlie's group). </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Apart from the various games we've played at dinner parties this will be my first attempt at doing improv. I'm a little worried about feeling shy and not being good at it but I've tried not to think about it too much. As always my dad was very encouraging by saying \"you're not funny\". We'll see. ![Supercouth](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12644808_504404106406789_4002322811981869821_n.jpg)</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Royal Ascot </span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I end up doing quite a few things with Ascot throughout the year because of my job. I've been to various race days but never Royal Ascot. This year I'm lucky enough to go along to Ladies Day. I think I've sorted my dress so all I need now is a hat to go with it and some shoes.  Watch this space. </span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Planning a</span>****<span class=\"s1\"> hen do </span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">[Remember](https://vikibell.com/posts/wedding-part-ii) when one of my bridesmaids caught my banquet? Well she's getting married in August and I'm helping plan her hen do in July. I love planning events so the chance to plan my best buddies hen is super exciting. I'm not revealing any details in case she reads this but trust me, it's going to be pretty awesome! </span>\n\n![Catching the bouquet](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1060.2061-1024x683.jpg)\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Suffolk </span>**\n\nIn a bit of preparation for the hen do and a bit because we haven't been up there since the start of May, we're off to my [happy place](http://vikibell.com/posts/9-things-to-do-around-thorpeness-aldeburgh) for the weekend soon. This means doing all of my favourite things and spamming my Instagram feed with shots of us walking through fields. YAY!\n\n![Sitting in the field in Suffolkj](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_9212-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Summer Fridays </span>**\n\nWho decided that leaving early on a Friday was a good idea? Thank you! To keep on trend with what all the cool companies are doing, my company is letting us escape at 4pm on Fridays during the summer. This inevitably means that we'll all end up across the road at the pub for the extra hour but, team bonding right?\n\n![Champagne](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/01ca6237b308eec0474bc3717cafa088f896650db2-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "As I mentioned in my Happy June [post](http://admin.vikibell.com/happy-june/), I was lucky enough to go to Royal Ascot this year. We went along to Ladies day and were in the Royal Enclosure which was very exciting! One of my favourite bits was getting dressed up for the day - I love any excuse to dress up. I wanted something which was summery but wasn’t full of pastel flower prints. I finally found mine from Joy which I wore with a relatively simple hat and strappy shoes. Charlie was in a top hat and tails and looked very dapper!\n\n![Royal Ascot ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_1051-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We made our way across London to Waterloo to join the crowd getting the train. The train was packed with people going to Ascot so if you go, make sure you get there early or you face standing for the hour journey. We stepped off the train and followed the sea of union jack bunting to the entrance. All the staff at Ascot were so happy and helpful, the atmosphere was super.</span>\n\n![Royal Ascot](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Royal-Ascot--1024x683.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After a quick coffee break we made our way to the enclosure to set up. We were in the Winning Post Gardens meaning that we were on the inside of the race track in a gazebo. Crossing the track was very fun! </span>\n\n![Royal Ascot ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Royal-Ascot-2-1024x683.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We’d brought along our picnic lunch and a copious amount of champagne. After popping open the bubbles it was time to welcome the Queen - it's not Royal Ascot without the royal family is it?! I opted to stay track side and managed to get very close to her. I’m pretty sure she waved directly to me after I took this shot.![Royal Ascot ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Royal-Ascot-4-1024x684.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then it was time for the first race. I’m not really into horse racing but I did enjoy cheering on the winners. The track is so big that it’s only on the final straight that you can actually see the horses, otherwise you watch on the massive screens dotted around. I was amazed at the power of them as they races by and slightly appalled at the whipping sounds as the horses were encouraged to go faster. ![Royal Ascot ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_0282-1024x699.jpg) </span><span class=\"s1\">The day passed with a champagne blur as we watched the races and explored the main side of the Ascot track. We put a few bets on the races but didn’t win anything upsettingly - maybe our tactic of picking the best names wasn’t a good plan! After the races we headed to the bandstand for the traditional sing-song and then back to the enclosure when crackles of thunder threatened above us.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Royal Ascot ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Royal-Ascot-3-1024x768.jpg)We sat there for another hour chatting and drinking in hope of avoiding the crowds before heading back on the train home. Royal Ascot was a really lovely day out at a very British event and one I’d love to repeat next year. ![Royal Ascot ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_1075-1024x768.jpg)</span>",

That sounds strange, doesn't it? Well, that's pretty much what hot yoga is as I found out when I went along for a class at [Fitness First](http://www.fitnessfirst.co.uk/inside-track/lifestyle/gonna-make-sweat-hot-yoga/).\n\n<div>I've never been to a gym before (unless you count classes in school) so it was an evening of firsts. I'm more of a swimmer than someone who works out but yoga seemed like somewhere I could start off. We were given a quick tour of the gym when we arrived which was interesting. I don't think you'd ever catch me on the running machines it's just so boring to run in one spot. I think the best section was the freestyle area where you can do whatever exercise you like without being restricted. Apparently, it's becoming quite a popular part of gyms so maybe that'll be my next step!</div>\n\n<div>![Hot Yoga](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1182-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Anyway, all changed and pretending to look the part, we headed down to the hot room. I loved the darkness and red lighting. That combined with the heat was really calming for me as soon as I stepped inside. It's safe to say the dark lighting and sweaty bodies didn't make for great photos so you'll just have to imagine it. Or pretend I'm this girl!</div>\n\n<div>![Yoga](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Yoga2-1024x681.jpg \"Photo credit: Shutterstock\")</div>\n\n<div>Our teacher took us through various poses and stretches that felt pretty easy to do. The only one I struggled with was when you have to lift one leg and the opposite arm off the floor - balance is not my strong point. The 45 minute lesson passed pretty quickly. Suddenly we were at the end and sitting with our eyes shut, almost meditating. For my first experience I really enjoyed myself. I'd love to go back and try some more hot yoga - anyone want a yoga buddy?</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>I'd heard a lot of good things about [The Gate](http://thegaterestaurants.com/) but had never got around to going until the wonderful [Katy](http://www.littlemisskaty.co.uk/2016/06/vegetarian-lunch-gate-islington.html) invited me for lunch. The Gate is a totally vegetarian restaurant and although I enjoy vegetarian food I wasn't convinced how much I'd enjoy a whole vegetarian meal. Spoiler alert - the food was amazing, I didn't miss meat at all and would love to go back again. The food was so tasty and felt super healthy.</div>\n\n<div>I have a few vegetarian friends and I always struggle to cook for them; it just feels like I've forgotten the meat part of the meal. The Gate's menu was bursting with inspiration and I'll definitely be referring back to it and trying to create a few of the dishes when they next come over.</div>\n\n<div>![The Gate](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0577-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>The gate is super easy to find, just south of Angel tube. They also have another one in Hammersmith if you live west. It was the perfect place for lunch (or dinner) - light and healthy feeling. There was so much that I would choose from on the menu. I changed my mind quite a few times before finally ordering the _Asian red quinoa and miso salad_. I'm slightly obsessed with Quinoa at the moment and keep making the same chicken and chorizo quinoa mix but this was a yummy alternative. I love the asian flavours and the crunch of the fresh vegetables.</div>\n\n<div>![The Gate](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_05841-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Whereas my salad had a strong summer vibe, Katy's was the ultimate comfort food. She'd ordered the _root vegetable hash_ which was topped with poached egg and mushroom sauce - yummy!</div>\n\n<div>![The Gate](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0591-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>One thing that striked me was that the food was all so colourful, I took a peak at some of the other dishes on the tables and it all looked good! Inspired by the table next to us we also ordered a side of Polenta chips with garlic aioli which I'd never had before. They were nice but a bit boring compared to my main which was oozing with flavours.</div>\n\n<div>We were so full afterwards that, although we were tempted, we skipped dessert and headed back outside to the sunshine. I'd easily recommend The Gate for some good, healthy food without a ridiculous price tag (it's around £8 for a main). It's also super close to the Sadlers Wells theatre so the perfect place to stop in for a pre-show dinner.</div>\n\n<div>**All food was complimentary but as always, I wouldn't talk about it if I didn't love it.</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "[Alec](http://alecsrestaurant.co.uk/)'s is one of 'the' places to go for lunch or dinner if you live in Essex. There's usually someone remotely famous in there and it's full of a lot of fancy looking Essex boys and girls sipping champagne. The reputation isn't really my thing but the food, setting and staff are all wonderful. It's based in Navestock which is a tiny little village about a ten minute drive out of Brentwood. We usually go to Alec's for a special occasion, I went for dinner a few years ago to celebrate my brother's 21st and we returned again recently for my other brother's 18th. This time for Sunday lunch. This means it's the same menu as evening just with an added option of roast beef. The menu had a lot of fish options as well as steak or surf and turf. I admit that I struggled to pick this time, part to do with my hangover from the night before and part because, as usual, I wanted to try everything. ![Alec's](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0710-1024x744.jpg) I had a gin and tonic whilst I was deciding - nothing like hair of the dog! Finally settling on the jumbo tiger prawn and scallops with sweet spicy soy sauce followed by the roast cod, sweet soy & caramelised spring onion glaze. My starter was wonderful I was a little upset when it was finished as it was so good. There was a larger version available for a main which my dad picked. ![Alec's prawn and scallop](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0706-1024x712.jpg)   When the mains arrived I wasn't a big fan of how mine looked. I almost didn't upload the photo as it's not the most appealing. Especially compared to everyone else's. It looked very small and boring and I had no idea how it was going to fill me up. Oh I was wrong. I couldn't even finish it. The fish fell apart like butter and was coated in this very rich sauce. I think I would have been happy with half of it! ![Alec's](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0711-1024x714.jpg) We were pretty full so ended up skipping dessert and instead stayed sitting around the table slowly finishing our wine. If you live in Essex I'd recommend visiting Alec's for a special occasion. Just make sure you book in advance as it's always pretty busy. ![Alec's](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0712-1024x718.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "If you've been following me on snapchat recently, you'll know that I've just hosted the most incredible gender neutral hen do for my buddy Ellie. I thought I'd share a few tips on how to host an awesome hen do. ![Glastonellie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13613441_10157367044470001_2461613349075778168_o-1024x768.jpg) **Ask the bride to be what she wants and respect that ** It's really important to ask the bride what she wants. You'll go to loads of hen dos in your time but you'll only get thrown one so make sure she gets what she wants. Our only instructions for Glastonellie were no sashes or learner plates and lots of prosecco and sea. We had prosecco flowing all weekend and topped it off with a swim in the sea WITH prosecco on Sunday morning. ![Glastonellie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13603472_10157367035940001_8891935558905332302_o-e1468581910625-1024x784.jpg) **Break the ice with a few games ** Keep in mind that the mix of people you throw together for the hen do might not know each other that well or worst, a couple of people won't know the 'in' jokes of the crowd of school friends. It helps to have a few games up your sleeve so that you can get everyone bonding and laughing together. The classic game we played was where the groom had given us answers to a few questions about Ellie such as her favourite foods. Ellie then had to guess his answers. If she got it right we all had to drink, if she got it wrong then she had to drink. The answers weren’t always what she would have said so she had to drink a lot! Another game we played was a competition to create a wedding dress using bin bags, tin foil and sellotape. ![Glastonellie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13613131_10157367037780001_567240760826303134_o-1024x683.jpg) **If she says no strippers that means no strippers** You can usually tell when someone says no strippers and means it. I said no strippers on my hen do but I wasn't that surprised when one turned up and proceeded to make my next half hour hilariously awkward. I actually had two and the butler in the buff who turned out to be a friend of the host was by far more funny and fun than the actual stripper (who the company sent as a replacement for the actually okay looking guy the girls had ordered - that happens a lot!) Ellie on the other had meant no strippers. She'd been to mine and watched it all and knew that it wasn't for her so we obviously didn't get one. ![Glastonellie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13559002_10157367032405001_268835162539879370_o-1024x683.jpg) **Be upfront about cost ** Cost is a big thing when it comes to hen dos. Especially if you're going abroad or staying somewhere else. Keep it as cheap as you can and work out your priority. It's great spending £20 on sashes and banners but does anyone have them leftover from another hen do? We worked out our costs and detailed what it included to everyone. This meant they all knew exactly what they were getting for the price. We also covered the cost of Ellie - I don't think it's fair for the bride to pay for the hen do and spreading her cost only worked out a few pounds extra for everyone. ![Glastonellie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13528254_10157367037190001_7387247304381049805_o-1024x683.jpg) **Surprises bring unlimited smiles ** You can fit so many surprises into a day or weekend for a hen do and it's so lovely to watch the bride's face light up as she realised what's been planned. With months of planning on the run up to the wedding, it's also just nice for her to have a weekend off where she doesn't have to think of anything. Our biggest surprise of the weekend was mini golf. Both the bride and groom love it so when we knew there wasn't one near us we decided to make one in the woods. By rearranging a few tree trunks, making some flags and racking up the leaves we had a 3 hole course. I had thought that it wouldn't work as well as it did but we split into three teams and kept score with some specific scorecards I'd designed. We played the whole course twice and were laughing every time someone got a ball through and Ellie face. It was so much fun. ![Mini Golf](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13607011_10157363887685001_4270879740408436752_n.jpg) **Have fun ** Lastly, enjoy it! You're hosting and therefore need to make sure things run smoothly but as long as you've worked out the day plans and foreseen any issues (like a thunderstorm passing over us as we were about to play mini golf) you can sit back and enjoy the weekend. Don't forget to take lots of pictures! ![Glastonellie](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13528170_10157367039035001_386975234562066149_o-1024x683.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>[Latitude festival](http://www.latitudefestival.com/) happens just around the corner from Shellpits and I went for the first time five years ago. There were various jokes last year about how we couldn't go as that was the same weekend as our wedding. So we decided to all go this year to celebrate our anniversary!</div>\n\n<div>We went along for the Saturday. It was so nice to just go along for a day and skip the grime of the campsites. I only had one band that I wanted to see, Soulwax, so it was really cool to be laid back and just discover new acts. We spent most of the morning watching comedy. We started off with joe Bor as Jasper Cromwell-jones, a posh twat talking about his life as an adventure. He had various 'posh-offs' with the audience throughout the set. Next up was Boy With Tape On His Face. I'd seen him a few years ago but couldn't quite remember. Describing his set won't do it justice but it's well worth watching. ![Latitude Festival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1593-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Then we had a beer break and met up with the rest of the group who we'd managed to lose. We picked our next act randomly and ended up going to see Marcel Lecont - the French alter ago of Alexis Dubis. His set was based around interaction with the audience, sexual poetry and taking the piss out of Brits. We'd all written a few moans down for him before the show started including out worst day at work, worst sexual experience and worst experience abroad. All of our experiences got read out and the rest of the audience ended up turning and laughing at us as Marcel proceeded to make fun of what we'd said. There was a few points in the show where I was crying with laughter. He's heading to Edinburgh Fringe so check him out of you're going!</div>\n\n<div>![Latitude Festival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1597-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>After another beer break and some lunch we went across to Paul Merton. As we got near we saw that the queue to get into the tent was ridiculously long. The steward told us it wasn't worth joining so we sat in the woods to watch on a screen instead. It was still hilariously good, even with the trees slightly in the way. They played loads of the improv games I recognised and it made me so happy that I've discovered improv. It was a really chilled vibe, just sitting in the woods with a bottle of wine watching improv.</div>\n\n<div>![Latitude Festival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0011-768x1024.jpg)After meeting up with the others (who we'd lost again!) at the main stage we had a quick play in the playground with Mabel -our excuse to go down the helter skelter! Then we were back in the comedy tent to watch Josh Widdicombe who was headlining.</div>\n\n<div>![Latitude Festival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1903-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div> Straight after that we ran across to the waterfront stage where India and I had a tango lesson. We tried our best but it's safe to say that we won't be spinning each other around anytime soon! ![Tango dancing](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1904-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>It was coming up to 8pm by this point and some of the adults headed home leaving us to hit the music stages. We saw Chvrches who I'd only just started listening to a week or so before. They had a wonderful stage presence and Lauren Mayberry was jumping around with so much energy it was a wonder that she had any breath left to sing! ![Latitude Festival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1634-1024x768.jpg)![IMG_1706](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_17061-1024x768.jpg)After another beer and food break we headed to the BBC Radio stage ready to see Soulwax. With the day being so chilled it was nice to have a band to jump around too. They had three drum sets on stage and everyone was so energetic it was difficult not to throw myself around to the beats. Our flailing arms and jumping about was definitely more of a work out than dancing but it was so much fun.</div>\n\n<div>![Latitude Festival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1735-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div> Nearing the end of the day, we had an hour to wait until our taxi so took a stroll around the woods. Latitude at night feels truly magical. The trees are lit up with fairy lights and there are loads of little tents with strange things going on inside. My favourite was the robot tent - we saw lots of cardboard boxes which looked like robot heads so put them on and went inside this tiny gazebo  playing Robot Rock with a DJ and strobe lighting. Another part of the woods had projections on trees showing old films. The whole thing feels so surreal that is wonderful. ![Latitude Festival](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0029-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div> Latitude has so much to offer and it was so good to spend time at a festival discovering new talents and experiences rather than just sticking by the music stages. Every time I've been to Latitude I've only known one or two people on the lineup but I've come away with so many different artists in my head. Whether you go for a weekend or just a day Latitude is the perfect festival for discovering new talents and having a really fun day.</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">As well as going to Latitude to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, we also planned a trip around some of Europe. A few of our friends were heading to a festival in Amsterdam so instead of jumping on a plane and going straight there we decided to stop off at a few places along the way, fitting in five different places in seven days.</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Lille</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">On Tuesday we jumped on the Eurostar and headed to Lille. We booked the tickets about three weeks before and found that the premium class was actually cheaper than standard - one to watch out for. We arrived in Lille at about 3pm and our Airbnb host, Frank, was waiting to greet us. After a quick stop off at the flat we headed to the city centre armed with a map and a few scribbled suggestions. We'd done some last minute research about Lille on the train but Frank had mentioned that the buildings were far prettier outside than in and to simply walk around the Grand Place - the main square. ![Lille](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_3361-1024x683.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We saw the Notre Dame de la Treille and wondered the back streets before settling down at a little restaurant for dinner.</span>\n\n![Lille food](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1790-768x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The next day we headed out for breakfast and ended up walking around the Parc Zoologique. It was a fairly small zoo but we made the most of it and even ended up catching a few Pokemon on the way! Then we picked up our bags and caught the train to the next destination on our Europe tour….</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Lille zoo](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_3375-1024x683.jpg)</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Ghent</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We arrived in Ghent around 3 and walked straight to our next Airbnb. This was one of my favourites in terms of decorations as there was so much memorabilia and music instruments having from the walls. After dropping our bags our host directed us to the city centre towards Gentse Feesten - Ghent's annual street festival. Around 2 million people attend the festival each year making it one of the biggest in Europe. The first stop on our festival tour was a the Saint Nicholas Church which had a bar inside. Who could say no to sampling a few Belgium beers in a church?!</span>\n\n![Gentse Feesten](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1819-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Sticking to Belgium culture we next headed off for mussels and chips, with a few more beers of course. Then we took a walk around each of the stages listening to tribute bands, local pop acts and a DJ in a mardi gras tent.![Gentse Feesten](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1824-1024x768.jpg)![Gentse Feesten](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1834-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We couldn’t get over how beautiful all the building were and how juxtaposed they were behind the stages that had been set up.![Gentse Feesten](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1836-768x1024.jpg)</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Bruges</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The next day we packed up and caught an early train to Bruges. Another city, another Airbnb, this one was the whole house to ourselves and it was SO CUTE! After an explore we grabbed some lunch at De Middenstand which was a recommendation by our host. After running around Lille and Ghent it was quite a contrast and felt quite fancy. They even brought us a few taster dishes which were so tasty.</span>\n\n![De Middenstand](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1844-1024x768.jpg) ![De Middenstand](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1852-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then Richard arrived. For absolutely no reason he had decided to cycle to Amsterdam so we were meeting up with him for each of his stops. This was his first stop from London so we were there to cheer him on and hand him a beer as he arrived. We wanted to make the most of our afternoon so took a boat tour around the canals to see all of Bruges. It’s quite a small city so this was the best way to see everything at once and learn a little about it.![Bruges canal](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_3459-1024x683.jpg) ![Bruges](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_3456-1024x683.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We set off early again the next morning this time for Rotterdam. If you’re planning a visit to Bruges, I’d recommend 2 days so you can explore but it’s quite small so you don’t need too long.![Bruges](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_3468-1024x683.jpg)</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Rotterdam</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After a bit of a delay in Antwerp because our train got cancelled we finally arrived in [Rotterdam](http://admin.vikibell.com/a-weekend-in-rotterdam/) to see Catriona. After three nights in random homes it was really lovely to be chilling in her parents house. I went to Rotterdam last year to visit and her family are always super welcoming.</span>\n\n![Rotterdam](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1890-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">As I’d done most of the tourist things last year we decided to take it easy and cycle around the city centre to have a few beers. We raced back home to be there for when Richard arrived after his 9 hour cycle from Bruges. He still had a smile on his face so we decided to all cycle for a tapas dinner around Kralingse Bos (the big park and lake).![Rotterdam](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1895-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Amsterdam</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Our final stop of our Europe tour. We made it! Matt and Rob were waiting for us our last Airbnb just outside of the city centre. We spent two nights here so made the most of seeing the city and catching up over yet more beers on the first day before heading out to Liquidity festival on the Sunday.![Liquicity](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1908-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The whole holiday had built up to the festival. Liquicity is an online drum and bass music community which started off as a YouTube channel. This was the second year of the festival so although it is still quite small I was excited to see what was there and how I’d handle a full day of drum and bass!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Liquicity](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1945-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Liquicity ](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1976-1024x768.jpg)I had so much fun though, from quite a sleepy beginning we all found energy to jump about to the music. We weren’t the only ones making some strange movements, if you were sat on the floor you could see the ground rippling with the bass from the DJs. It looked mesmerising and also quite scary. My favourite part of the day was the Pendulum DJ set which headlined the main stage. Richard and I bounced about like crazy and covered each other in glitter.![Liquicity](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_1991-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A quick dash around Europe was so much fun. I’d never thought about making going to a festival so much of a holiday but it’s something I’d love to repeat again with another festival. It contrasted so much to the beginning of the holiday which was so chilled. That’s another few cities ticked off my bucket list!</span>",

      "wordpressContent": "Ever year we hold The Wood Party. It is what it says on the tin- a party in a wood. Ever year it gets bigger and better and this is the sixth time we've done it. From what started as a couple of teenagers sitting around a campfire has transformed into a night of mischief and mayhem in a wood and definitely one to remember. It doesn't happen by accident though, it takes planning to get people to the right place at the right time with the right atmosphere. Here are my tips for planning a party - whether that's in a wood or not!![13123068_10156834676545621_7013281413816248716_o](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/13123068_10156834676545621_7013281413816248716_o-1024x683.jpg) **(Some) people are lazy ** How often have you not planned your night out until it's time to go out the door? How far in advance do you plan how to get to a friend birthday party? Okay, saying that people are lazy is quite a generalisation but make sure you're upfront with you plans. We make the wood party as simple as possible to get to, from detailing train times to organising seats in cars. If it's far or complicated to get to people won't come; unless you make it easy for them. **(Some) people are skint ** A night out in Brixton? Sure. A night out in the middle of nowhere? Uh, how much will that set me back?! Not a lot in fact but it doesn't seem like that when you add up transport costs. It costs roughly £20 in petrol to get there (split that between 4 and that's about the cost of a pint), food costs around £5 (another pint), speaker hire costs £5 each (another pint) and booze costs however much you choose to drink. So for the price of three pints you've got yourself to a party in a wood - simple! Whereas a night out in Brixton costs a tube fare, entry fee, booze and possibly an uber home with a stop off at the chicken shop. Make sure you're upfront with your guests about any costs and if you're buying things for everyone beforehand (food) get the money in advance, that way any spare can go towards the all important booze table! **Atmosphere ** Okay, we're done on the people front but what else? Think about the kind of vibe you'll want to have and how to go about creating it. Think about decorations, music, themes and actually where you put everything. If you want the focus to be drinking then make sure the drinks are in the middle and on display whereas if you want the focus to be around dancing then make sure that's front and centre. Last year was our first with a generator and decks; it made a massive difference. Suddenly people were keen to show off their DJ skills, the music got louder and the night got crazier! ![Wood Party](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10570365_10152671547738767_4987122103683071032_n.jpg) **It gets dark ** Well duh! But when you hold an event in the middle of nowhere it gets pitch black dark. That's where solar lights come in. They're relatively cheap to buy and they last a long time. We arrive early and string them up between the trees and on the ground, marking out pathways and different areas. Come twilight the wood is light up like a mystical fairy wonderland. **Making memories ** After one hell of a party your memories are bound to be a little fuzzy. Make sure you take loads of photos and collect any that other people take afterwards. They work really well for us promoting the event next year too! It's only a couple of days until this year's Wood Party and planning is in full swing. If you're coming along, we've got a few big surprise in store too... ![P1000041](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/P1000041-1024x768.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Remember last year when I wrote about how much I love swimming and how it's totally going to be that hobby I pick back up? Well I may have failed myself a little there. That hobby all but lasted five sessions to the overcrowded pool in Victoria. I lacked the motivation to go by myself and whenever I did try and go swimming I got bored with repetitively swimming up and down, up and down, up and down..... So when an email landed in my inbox from [Fitness First](http://www.fitnessfirst.co.uk/inside-track/workouts/stay-cool-at-the-pool-this-summer/) for a swimming evening I thought I had no excuse. ![P1030425](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/P1030425-768x1024.jpg)\n\n<div>Two weeks before I went along to meet Jono, the manager who gave me a private tour around the gym as well as a few swimming lessons. I'm not ashamed to say that it was the second time I've ever been into a gym, the first being last month when I tried out [hot yoga](https://vikibell.com/posts/hot-yoga-class). I had this idea in my head that it would be full fo gym bunnies each staring each other down as they lifted their ten ton weights, turns out that's not the case. No one else was staring at each other, no one was laughing and all the gym staff were super friendly.</div>\n\n<div>Anyway, after a quick tour it was time for my lesson. We got in the pool and warned up. The last lesson I had was when I was around 5 years old so I was interested to see what Jono had to teach me. We started working through a diagram called BLABT which stands for body, legs, arms, breathing and time. For each of these Jono explained a few drill exercises, one of my favourites was where you swim front crawl but have your hands in fists. It just feels funny but improves your stroke loads when you switch back.</div>\n\n<div>![Swimming Hammersmith ](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1200_0007_ff-hammersmith-022-1024x427.png)</div>\n\n<div>I met up with Jono four times before the swimming event, twice I managed to drag Charlie along with the promise of a steam and sauna afterwards - which by the way is awesome in the Fitness First as they have all mood lighting and you feel like you're in a spa! I managed to fit my lessons in before or after work although I definitely prefer the before work lessons as they made me feel so much more energised for the day. For someone who likes to sleep this was the perfect excuse to get me out of bed.</div>\n\n<div>Anyway, the day finally came around for the #FFSwimSqaud meet and I found myself on poolside listening to Richard Stannard explain about his career as a triathlon superstar. The lesson passed pretty quickly with us all swimming lengths and trying to concentrate on different aspects of our strokes. Richard demonstrated a few techniques too and it was pretty cool to watch a pro swimming gliding through the water.</div>\n\n<div>![Swimming](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_3790-768x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>What did I learn from my lessons with Jono and session with Richard? Well quite a lot actually:</div>\n\n<div>\n\n*   Make sure you keep your body flat in the water\n*   Keep your head down - except when you breath of course!\n*   Let your arms skip your hips as they they pull backwards\n*   Kick from your hips not your feet - you can do this by twisting your hips as you swim\n*   Make your body as long as you can in the water\n*   Relax - if it feels natural then it's probably right\n\n</div>\n\n<div>I also now know a couple of drills I can do when I go swimming, meaning I don't just swim up and down pointlessly. I can actually aim for something and I'm more aware of how it feels to slice through the water. I've also discovered how easy it is to go swimming before work, now all I need to do is find a pool near me!!</div>\n\n<div>![Swimming](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_2227-1024x767.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>*photo credit to [Abbi!](http://www.UpraisedLiving.com)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>There is reason my photos aren't the best or the most refined. I don't take time to get the perfect shot of my food, I just enjoy it. I take a quick snap as a memory of where I've been and carry on whatever it is I'm doing. My time isn't taken up by living my life through a screen.</div>\n\n<div>What I saw last week was disappointing and that disappointment hasn't vanished overnight. Apple Music gave me a wonderful gift. The gift of a lifetime - to see [Elton John in the Roundhouse](http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/blog/2016/09/elton-john-at-apple-music-festival/). The Roundhouse isn't like any venue out there, it can hold a tiny capacity of just 1,700 which is nothing when compared to the Brixton academy or O2\\. As the name suggests, the stage is also round meaning the audience can get closer. Elton John isn't someone I listen to much but I know most of his songs. I'd say that other Elton fans might have deserved the tickets a little more but I'd won them and I wanted to make sure I appreciated that gift.</div>\n\n<div>As the lights dropped, the crowd cheered and I felt a tightness in my chest - I was about to see a legend. I was about to see the man who'd played for the queen, the man who was legendary throughout the world. Or so I thought.</div>\n\n<div>What I saw was 100s of phones being lifted in the air, friends and families dialled on FaceTime and even a woman in front of me casually checking her Twitter and Facebook feeds. I then saw heads bend in odd directions and girls going up on tiptoes just so they could peak around the screens and get a glimpse of the stage which was a couple of metres in front of them.</div>\n\n<div>![Elton John](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_3115-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>In all transparency, I admit that at the beginning of his second song I took a very quick snap. I shot my phone up into the air and captured an image then took it back down. I wanted a memory of the moment and an image I could refer back to but at the same time I wanted to watch the gig through my own eyes, not through a screen. If I wanted to watch through a screen wouldn't it have been easier to stay home and live stream it?</div>\n\n<div>All was not lost, in the moments where my view was clogged full of phone screens I shut my eyes and appreciated that at least I was there hearing the music.</div>\n\n<div>Elton John and his band were incredible. Everyone on stage looked so so happy to be there, as did his special guests which he brought on to perform their own songs. I was so grateful to have been given the chance to see the legend; it's just a shame that the crowd ruined the experience.</div>\n\n<div>Life isn't there to be lived through a lens. Photos are a great way of reliving memories but they shouldn't stand in the way of enjoying the moment. Go out this week, put the phone down and take some time to appreciate something special.</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>Remember last year when we went to the [Jane Packer ball](http://admin.vikibell.com/jane-packer-foundation-flower-ball/) and we won a pasta making course in the auction? (I use won in a very loose way - do you win an auction when you've had too many lemonades and think it's funny to try and outbid your mates?) Anyway, after one ludicrous evening we found ourselves enrolled onto a pasta making course.</div>\n\n<div>The six of us turned up nice and early at [La Cucina Caldesi](http://caldesi.com/) where Stefano and Marco greeted us with deliciously fresh Italian coffee. We didn't know too much about the course so they explained what we were doing and we were set to work on the pasta. First we each cracked eggs into a mixing bowl with flour and kneaded them together. Once everything had had a chance to bind together, we set them aside wrapped in cling film and got to work on the other ingredients.</div>\n\n<div>Somehow Sarah and I got entrusted with a rather large box of cherry tomatoes to chop.... yummy! We ended up eating more than we chopped but luckily no one noticed. The boys prepared garlic, chillies and the filling for the ravioli whist India and David were on dessert duty.![Pasta Making](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_3193-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Then it was time to roll out the pasta. Each ball was chopped into two/ three smaller balls and put through the pasta maker. We started with the ravioli which was the trickiest. The balls went through the press about six times, each time we changed the settings to make the gap smaller and the pasta sheet thinner. We did this until it went through the thinnest setting, then it was ready to use. A spoonful of ricotta and mint filling was put onto the middle of the sheet, then we folded it over itself and cupped around it. Excess pasta was chopped off making it into a rather recognisable ravioli shape. We pressed the edges in with a fork and set it aside for later. For six of us we make about 30 little raviolis.</div>\n\n<div>Next up was tagliatelle. This was my favourite part. We put the pasta ball through the press, working down the settings until the penultimate one which we did twice. Then we put our thin sheet through a kind of grate which we turned and out came tagliatelle! We threw this in a little flour to stop it sticking then set that aside too.</div>\n\n<div>With everything prepped it was time to cook. Salty water was boiling on the hob. Before you cook pasta you should make sure it's nice and salty and tastes like the sea in Southend - just less pollution! In went the ravioli for a couple of minutes whilst the sauces cooked. The first was a mint butter to go with the ravioli. The second was the tomorrow, garlic and chilli sauce and the final one was homemade pesto. ![Pasta Making](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_3214-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>After all our hard work it was time to sit down and enjoy it. With a bottle or two of wine of course. I usually make quite a big and flavoursome sauce which takes the taste away from the pasta, so it was quite different to have three sauces which complimented it rather than masked it. Using fresh ingredients made such a difference to the overall taste - and it was so easy!</div>\n\n<div>If you haven't given pasta making a go, [get yourself involved](http://caldesi.com/). Or at least ditch the pre-bought sauce and make your own.![Pasta making](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Pasta-making-1024x512.jpg)</div>",

We stayed with our friend, Ray who had helpfully left a to do list for us to work through.</div>\n\n**Friday **\n\n<div>After a light breakfast we headed out to tick off the most touristy thing in Barcelona, [Sagrada Familia.](http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/) As expected, it was stunning. Knowing that this was first started in 1882 and it's still being worked on is crazy. Imagine how many people have helped construct this in one way or another? What we thought was the front (we later found out it's due to be the side) was eye catching.</div>\n\n<div>The back contrasted it slightly and seemed more traditional. The whole thing is due to be finished in 2026 and is set to be the highest building in Barcelona and the tallest religious building in Europe.</div>\n\n<div>![Sagrada Familia](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_3532-1024x683.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>We jumped onto the metro and headed off to the port. The metro was a really convenient way to get around Barcelona with one ride working out to be a euro. After a walk around the port we stopped off at a random restaurant for tapas - when in Spain!</div>\n\n<div>![Tapas Barcelona](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_3541-21-1024x683.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>We spend the afternoon paddling our feet in the sea and walking along the beach. Then it was time to meet Ray for dinner. He took us to his favourite restaurant, Llamber. We had tapas again but this time it was on a whole different level. It was the best tapas I've ever had. It's not the cheapest of places but if you ever go to Barcelona you have to go. ![Llamber Barcelona](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2184-1024x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Then it was time for a surprise. After a stop off to pick up some cava, we jumped in a taxi and Ray muttered something in Spanish to the driver. Next thing I knew, we were them zooming off through the city and up into the hills. We got closer and saw loads of people gathering around. After showing some tickets to the gate man, Ray ushered us in. We were at a giant open cinema setting, overlooking Barcelona. They put these on throughout the summer and this was the last. No one knew what the film would be other than it was in English. The music stated and gasps spread through the crowd. It was the Godfather 2\\. Not the easiest film to pay attention to when you're a couple of bottles down but we made do by playing drinking games as we watched- much more fun than keeping up with the plot!</div>\n\n<div>**Saturday **</div>\n\n<div>We were up and out early, on our way to the Park Güell, another item on our list. We didn't know what to expect but we had a fair idea when we got out of the metro and started walking up hill. Park Güell overlooks the whole of Barcelona so the views were pretty insane. ![Barcelona](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2120-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>![Park Güell](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_3553-2-1024x683.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Afterwards we walked down via the Passeig De Gràcia where there are a couple of Gauldi buildings including Casa Batlló. The style is so unique to anything I've seen and they're a must see.</div>\n\n<div>It was approaching lunchtime so we went to the Mercado de La Boqueria to tick another thing off Ray's to do list. The market was split into different sections and had big stalls of meats, fresh (and even alive) fish and lots of smoothies and sweets. We had to get a meat cone whilst we walked around and I think it's be best cold meats I've ever had; so delicious! We picked out a little stall on the edge of the market for lunch and had a fish platter.</div>\n\n<div>![Mercado de La Boqueria](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2125-2-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Then it was time to hit the beach! We avoided the tourists on main beach and instead walked along to Nova beach. I paddled in the sea whilst Charlie guarded our belongings - that's the only annoying this about going on holiday with just two of you; you can't just leave your stuff on the beach and go in the sea together.</div>\n\n<div>After getting cleaned up at home we headed to [Pax 49](http://www.pax49bcn.com/)- a cocktail bar Ray had recommended. We took prime seats at the bar and sampled a few of their cocktails. I chose an expresso martini to begin as I was tired - that's pretty much the same as having a coffee right?!</div>\n\n<div>![Pax 49](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2133-1024x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>We got so wrapped up in conversation we didn't realise how late it was and we hadn't eaten. On the recommendation of the bartenders, who we got to know whilst sipping numerous cocktails, we went to Napoli - a tiny pizza place just around the corner. I would much rather go somewhere on the recommendation of a local, you get a much better feel for a place which is one of the reasons Barcelona was so good - everyone kept recommending places for us!</div>\n\n<div>**Sunday**</div>\n\n<div>The next day was our last so we took another look at our to do list and decided to tick off nudist beach. I've never been to one before so I though it would be a bit of a errr... experience? I'd expected to see a sea of naked bodies but actually only about a third of the people were naked. The rest were at least partially wearing bikinis or shorts. The beach was a lot less busy than the tourist beaches so I can see the appeal!</div>\n\n<div>We did a little sunbathing and I had a few dips in the sea before we walked back along to the more popular beach where there was food stands. It was our last day so we couldn't avoid having paella. We sat down in the sunshine overlooking the beach and the waves .... perfect!</div>\n\n<div>![Paella](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2136-2-1024x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>The rest of the day was pretty uneventful between sunbathing and a last catch up with Ray in the evening. We caught a stupidly early flight home from next morning in time to get back to work. I think we left a lot of things unexplored but we managed to fit in a lot for our long weekend without it being too stressful.</div>\n\n<div>![Barcelona](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2134-1024x1024.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>I love the time of year when the leaves fall from the trees and crunch beneath your feel. I love the nights turning darker and everything getting a little spookier and of course, I love Halloween. [Last year](http://admin.vikibell.com/halloween/) we ended up with quite last minute plans but everything seemed to fall into place. One of my favourite parts of Halloween is the fancy dress; not just wearing it but making it. We spent our whole Saturday thinking up what we were going to do then creating it. I think it was pretty good for a days effort!!</div>\n\n<div>![](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_7577-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Anyway, with Halloween fast approaching here's a few tips for you.</div>\n\n<div>**The costume **</div>\n\n<div>Go big or go home! You can always be underdressed at Halloween but I don't think you can ever be over dressed. You're never too old for a fancy dress box and there are a couple of essential items you need to keep in there:</div>\n\n*   A corset (if you're female!) - my corset has become part of countless fancy dress costumes. It started as the base for 17 year old me's poison ivy costume and had since been used for clowns, vampires and whores.\n*   A black/ white t shirt (if you're a guy) - you can use this as a base for a lot of things, just rip it up and pair it with a few items and you'll be a pirate, zombie, priest ....\n*   Spray paint - this is pretty essential. If you don't have time to dye clothes then just spray paint them. It's how we made Charlie's waistcoat and shoes for last year's costume\n*   Liquid eyeliner - you can use this to sketch the outlines of your face paint or draw a few intricate details like this cobweb.\n*   Black and white face paint - I buy snazaroo because it's the best I've found. It's quite expensive for a one off purchase but it lasts for ages. Failing that you can use a mixture of eye shadows and eye pencils to draw on your face too.\n*   Black plimsoles- my ancient primary plimsoles have become part of many a Halloween outfits. They're small and don't stand out meaning the suit the purpose of a shoe without looking out of place\n*   Fake blood - for Halloween only. Unless you're going to a Halloween party in March as I one did, but that's another story.\n\n<div>![Fancy Dress](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_7579-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>**The cocktails **</div>\n\n<div>This is a cocktail I made a while ago when we threw a Halloween party at our flat. The recipe below is for one but you can double or triple up to make more of a punch as I did.</div>\n\n<div>_For the eyeball ice cube _</div>\n\n<div>Put either a blueberry or a raspberry inside of a lychee, space them out on baking trays and freeze overnight.</div>\n\n<div>_For the drink _</div>\n\n<div>Mix 25ml vodka, 25ml white rum and 50ml cranberry juice. Top with lemonade and garnish with your ice cubes and serve in a jar.</div>\n\n<div>![Halloween cocktail](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8732-768x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>**The plans **</div>\n\n<div>I somehow always leave plans to last minute but so far haven't found a bad night. I do have to shift through a lot of boring looking options though. Most clubs will put on a Halloween night just because they can. You can go out dancing any night of the year so try and make sure there is something else on offer too. Be aware of boat trips  all these do is shove you on a boat down the Thames with some music, overpriced drinks and lots of people.</div>\n\n<div>Last year we went to [The Pond](http://pond-dalston.com/) in Dalston which put on a feast for us with circus acts and live music. It was quite a small venue but everyone was dressed up and it seemed really friendly. This year I've picked a club night but it's promising circus acts, cabaret and dancing - fingers crossed it'll be good!! I still need to decide what to dress as though....</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>On Friday night I went along to another immersive theatre experience with [CoLab](http://www.colabtheatre.co.uk/hunted/). This one was called HUNTED and I had no idea what to expect. The only instructions we were given was to turn up at Waterloo station at a certain time with a fully charged phone, 8mb of data and headphones; at 7.30pm exactly we had to text a number. The number then sent us a link to a file which would get us to safety. Security protocol 74 had been initiated.</div>\n\n<div>What happened next? Well I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say that we were hunted through the streets of London. There was running involved and a few small spaces to climb through. We suspected everyone. Anyone could be watching us and we had to get away. Fast. We had to survive. Our lives hung on the decisions we made and how fast we acted.</div>\n\n<div>We had taken a few friends along who had never seen immersive theatre before and they really enjoyed it. One wasn't sure he wanted to take it seriously to begin with but I pointed out that the more you take it seriously, the more you enjoy then experience. You need to believe that you really are being hunted by baddies rather than actors and you need to throw yourself into the scene and enjoy it.</div>\n\n<div>Want to try it out for yourself? HUNTED is on every Thursday, Friday and Saturday until the end of November and tickets cost just £11 each - bargain! ![HUNTED](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3640-1024x768.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>I can't remember the last time I went to a West End show. Booking tickets to something that's on for months always drops down my priorities list. When [Erica](http://www.imbeingerica.com/) asked if I wanted to come along to see Dead Funny with her I couldn't turn it down. And go for dinner first? Even better!! ![All Bar One](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3717-1024x781.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>We both met at [All Bar One](http://www.allbarone.co.uk/) which had just been refurbished. It looked pretty swanky in there with funky looking lamps hanging over the tables, not to mention possibly the best neon sign in existence! ![All Bar One](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3714-1024x768.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>It also wasn't a tourist trap either, despite being located in Leicester Square. Fitting in a decent meal before the theatre can sometimes feel quite rushed but this didn't at all. The waiter, Juan, kept checking in on us to see if we needed anything and made sure our food came out quickly. We started with a sharing platter which had calamari (yum), chicken skewers, haloumi and chorizo skewers, home made tortillas (with just the right amount of tang) and hummus and pitta. We devoured it over a bottle of wine before tucking into steak with parmesan chips. Oh, and sweet potatoes fries because, well, you can never not order them when they're on a menu. I'd never had parmesan fries before but there were really good although quite cheesy for a whole portion. ![All Bar One](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3713-1024x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Bellies full we realised we had fifteen minutes until the show started so we scooted along to the Vaudeville theatre ready for Dead Funny to start. The play was written by Terry Johnson and was first performed in 1994\\. It's set in 1992, the year Benny Hill died, followed by Frankie Howerd a few days later. The characters are part of comedy appreciation society, the Dead Funny Society, which comes together to mourn the passing of the comedians. Throughout the storyline we learn more about how Eleanor wants a child but is frustrated when her husband has no interest in touching her, the not so perfect marriage of Nick and Lisa and the overly mothered Brian, who just wants everyone to be happy. ![Dead Funny](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3733-1024x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>The performance was strong; the show does what the name suggestions - it was dead funny. My favourite character was easily Eleanor, played by Katherine Parkinson, who came out with some of the funniest remarks about her husband and the rest of the cast. It's also the first performance I've seen with full on nudity and boy, I was not ready for that. Cue some very immature giggles!</div>\n\n<div>A Tuesday night of culture was pretty good! You can catch Dead Funny on at the Vaudeville theatre until 4th February 2017\\. Thanks for the invite [London Theatre Bloggers](http://theatrebloggers.co.uk/) and [Stagedoor](http://apple.co/1sglYkH) (a handy little app for finding new shows to see).</div>\n\n<div>[caption id=\"attachment_1615\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]![Dead Funny performed at the Vaudeville Theatre Katherine Parkinson as Eleanor, Steve Pemberton as Brian, Emily Berrington as Lisa,Rufus Jones as Richard; Ralf Little as Nick ©Alastair Muir 01.11.16](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DeadFunny_GroupShot3_AlistairMuir-1024x771.jpg) Katherine Parkinson as Eleanor, Steve Pemberton as Brian, Emily Berrington as Lisa, Rufus Jones as Richard; Ralf Little as Nick  \nImage ©Alastair Muir 01.11.16[/caption]</div>\n\n<div> **I was a guest of both All Bar One and Dead Funny but as always, my reviews wouldn't be here if I didn't love it.</div>",

      "postSlug": "prs-look-bloggers",
      "postDate": "2016-11-18 11:01:14",
      "wordpressContent": "<div>I've heard a lot of bloggers wonder why they are chosen for campaigns over other bloggers. This was particularly so at an event I went to recently - some bloggers did something a little different before it started and others were just invited to the main event (a big no no in my opinion but let's not go into that). It got me thinking about why we chose certain bloggers for campaigns and not others. I'm putting my 'outreach' hat on and sharing my reasons for choosing a blogger to work with. These nine points may come across quite harsh but this is a behind the scenes glimpse into my choices:</div>\n\n<div>**1\\. They fit the brief**</div>\n\n<div>Bloggers need to fit the brief 100%. There's no point working with a 20 year old beauty blogger if your client's target audience is 40 year old parents. They also have to be influential on key platforms. For example, if I'm looking to grow a client's Instagram I'll look for Instagrammers. They won't even have to have a blog (that's just an extra). **2\\. They fit the client** If I'm looking for a blogger to write about a luxury brand, they'll have to have a feel of luxury themselves. The client will have to like them too which purely comes down to personal opinion so this can sometimes be tricky! **3\\. They're responsive** I know that some bloggers may get hundreds of emails a day but, if you expect us to reply quickly, we expect you to as well. Campaign outreach happens quite quickly so, if you don't respond within a day or so of my email it's likely I'll have moved on to look for someone else. I've got a client waiting on results remember. **4\\. They have an engaged audience** I've recently noticed a couple of top big bloggers who use follow, unfollow tactic or have bought their followers. It shows. It might get you noticed but why would I want to work on a campaign with you if your audience is a bunch of bots? The best bloggers to work with are ones with mid-high engagement on their posts. I'll be reporting back on how many likes, shares, comments or retweets their post gets so it's important for me to know that I'm likely to get good results. **5\\. Their stats match the KPIs of the campaign** Sometimes a client wants something very specific and you need to work to that. One campaign I worked on had to have bloggers with a domain authority (DA) of over 25 who don't post sponsored content (that was pretty much near impossible to find). DA is an initial judge to see if a blog is good but it doesn't come down to just that. I look at both follower numbers and engagement. Social shares are going to be important in any blog post so, if a client is particularly keen to expand one channel, I'll make sure my blogger has an active and engaged presence on that channel. **6\\. The blog or channel isn't packed with sponsored content** There needs to be a balance. I don't particularly like reading heavily sponsored content so why would your readers? I've come across a few parenting blogs which just contain sponsored, heavily key-worded content and giveaways. It just looks spammy. If you are writing a lot of sponsored content, think about what your audience wants to read and make the post useful for them. **7\\. They're nice to work with** If I've worked with a blogger before, they have delivered their work and they were polite and friendly, then I'll put them forward for more campaigns. Working with bloggers you've previously worked with is great as you both know how each other likes to work. It's also one of the reasons I like to meet bloggers face to face too. **8\\. They write good content** I'm talking about creative, well written content. Reading generic posts which don't have a point to them doesn't give me a lot of faith that I'll be proud of the work a blogger created for me. I want to see creativity and personality in posts. **9\\. They care about their writing** This is similar to the last one. Unfortunately I'm very good at spotting typos in blog posts (even spotting when there are extra spaces in text) I'm increasingly noticing them in a lot of big blogs. Everyone occasionally makes makes spelling mistakes (and I'm sure you'll be able to find one or two in my posts), but if a blog is littered with them it looks like they don't care about their writing. I know that posts usually fit around a 9-5 job on top of a hectic social life but it takes ten minutes to read something through properly. If I'm paying a blogger to write something I'd expect to see the post first, not to change the content but just to check it over. Put yourself in the shoes of the client, they're not going to be too happy to read a post about their brand which is littered with typos and it reflects badly on the PR.</div>\n\n**10\\. They want to work on the campaign** Lastly, the blogger has to actually want to work on the campaign. There's been quite a few times that the blogger is a perfect fit but they'll decline to be involved. It might just be that they are too busy or that they don't like the brand. At the end of the day it's the blogger's decision to take up the offer.  \n\n<div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>There are a lot of factors which go into why I choose to work with a blogger. It's not always a numbers game. Sometimes I've lined up the perfect blogger and the client just doesn't like them so I have to go back to square one. Everything I've said above, can pretty much be applied to all sorts of influencers, not just bloggers.</div>\n\n<div>_What's my main advice to you?_</div>\n\n<div>Don't get caught up in the numbers. Don't write a blog or start an Instagram channel or whatever it is you want to do just so PRs will contact you. Start it because you want to and because you care about what you're doing. It shines through and PRs WILL notice that.</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

I've been scrolling back through old photos and trying to remember everything just so I could bring you my nine 90s throwbacks.</div>\n\n<div>**1\\. Shag bands**</div>\n\n<div>Remember these? You used to cross them over on your wrists and if someone broke one they had to do certain sexual things. I googled these just now and found an article where an eight year old girl said to her mum: if a boy snaps a black band I have to make a baby with him.\" Why?! Because he snapped a bit of plastic?! That was a particularly strange craze.</div>\n\n<div>**2\\. Crash Bandicoot**</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>I can remember getting a Playstation when we lived in our old house and playing Crash Bandicoot and the Lemmings on it. Crash was my favourite though, I loved getting all those apples and spinning the crabs out the way! Did you hear that it's getting [remastered](https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/805114347311611904)?! If you're looking to reminisce in the meantime then look no further as GarlandTheGreat has the game one Youtube:</div>\n\n<div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xK-h4M4Aetg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>**3\\. Laces in the playground**</div>\n\n<div>I moved schools in year four and discovered a whole new thing - break time snacks! At morning break we all used to get together and trade snacks. The best snack you could have was strawberry laces, ideally fizzy ones. I tasted them a year or so ago and they were disgusting, just a ball of sour sugar - yuck.</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>**4\\. Word Art**</div>\n\n<div>Remember when you'd spend ages picking the word art before you even started your homework then you'd sat back satisfied that you were definitely going to get 100% because your title looked so damn good?! The rainbow one was by far my favourite.</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>**5. Mr Motivator**</div>\n\n<div>This guy was awesome! Everyone's mum owned a VHS with Mr Motivator doing his thing on it. The lycra, the bum bag and of course the motivation - it was all brilliant. We got to see him live when we went to Bestival earlier this year, we'd woken up hungover and in the pouring rain but after a session with him we felt ready for the day.</div>\n\n<div>![Mr Motivator at Bestival ](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_3081-1024x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>**6\\. Mood rings**</div>\n\n<div>These little babies were the ultimate insight into a friends mood. Just take a look at their mood ring and judge away. Blue and green meant fairly normal but other colours like orange meant unsettled and black even meant depressed</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>**7\\. Little red car**</div>\n\n<div>My first car was so reliable, never ran out of petrol and always got a parking space. At the first glimpse of spring my brother and I would always rush out to the garden to wash our toys down including this little car. Everyone I knew had one and as I couldn't find a pic of mine here's Charlie looking absolutely adorable in his!</div>\n\n<div>![Red and yellow car](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/summer-1992103-e1480842775394-791x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>**8\\. The Sims**</div>\n\n<div>I'm not sure when we first got a computer at home but at some point I discovered The Sims. My friend and I used to spend hours planning and building our houses (after doing the money cheat of course). I think the only time we actually played the 'live' bit was when we made our crush fall in love with us. Oh, and you'd buy that vibrating heart bed so your characters could have sex and babies and stuff. Looking back now that seems super weird for ten year old me to be playing.</div>\n\n<div>**9\\. The Spice Girls**</div>\n\n<div>Were you getting worried that I'd wouldn't mention my top 90s throwback?! Of course it's the Spice Girls. I bloody love them. I remember being super jealous that my cousins had Spice Girls T-shirts and I didn't. We all got together again a few years ago for the West End show and of course we had to dress up! We were singing along to all the songs and during the interval loads of the crowd came up to us to have their photos taken. ![Spice Girls](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SAM_6114-1024x768.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>I can remember writing a very specific life ambitions list on my Facebook when I was younger. It involved things like hug a man in a giant chicken suit (done) and own a loft apartment in New York (not done). I think that list needs a bit of an update so I've been thinking about what I actually want to achieve. 2015 saw me do two big life goals at once by getting [married](http://admin.vikibell.com/wedding-day-part-i/) and [buying a house](http://admin.vikibell.com/decorating-tips/) (well a flat but it still counts right?). Our wedding was amazing and although we're still decorating our flat, I'm really proud to have somewhere of my own. So what's next on my life agenda?</div>\n\n<div>**1\\. Visit South America**</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>I've heard loads of good things about exploring South America. I don't have anywhere specifically in mind so if you have any tips then let me know!</div>\n\n<div>I'm trying to work through the continents and South America is one I've not had a chance to visit yet. At some point I'm going to plot everywhere I've been onto a map and host it on there so... watch this space.</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>**2\\. Own a house**</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>I know I have a flat right now, it's wonderful and I'm incredibly lucky to live there but, eventually, I want to own somewhere with stairs and a spare room. I imagine that we'll stay where we are until we cross the big scary bridge that is having kids, then we'll look for somewhere bigger and obviously have to move out of London. Wow I sound like an adult don't I?! Anyway, that leads me on nicely to my next point.</div>\n\n<div>**3\\. Have children**</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<div>This is far far far off in the future (sorry Nan!) I'm having far too much fun at the moment without having to worry about smelly nappies; not to mention having to deal with a hangover and a child at once. See! The fact that I'm planning on having to look after a mini human whilst hungover just proves that I'm not ready. So at some point there will be mini-me's but not anytime soon.</div>\n\n<div>**4\\. Be an extra in a movie**</div>\n\n<div>This one has made it on from my original list. There was something I did at school which involved something to do with 28 days later - very vague. I wasn't too sure what I signed up for or even what it was but seeing as my name isn't in the credits it doesn't count. I'd just like my five seconds of fame by walking across the background or sitting in a bar or something in a movie. I'm quite happy with whatever it is.</div>\n\n<div>**5\\. Sell a piece of art**</div>\n\n<div>I've sold two paintings in my life which I'm pretty proud of. One was to my a level art teacher, Miss Mackie and the other was to a colour professor at the University of Leeds who just happened to stumble across it and loved it. I've always loved making art and I always say I want to do more, my biggest issue is space. I have so many canvas' around the house but no where for them to go. I don't want to paint over them but I can't keep storing them in everyone's garages. Maybe I'll make a section dedicated to them on here at some point...</div>\n\n<div>**6\\. Take a course in photography**</div>\n\n<div>I love taking photos and playing around with my camera. I did a photography module in uni but we mainly learnt about the history of photography. I'd love to go somewhere for a week and be instructed how to take great photos as I'm using my camera. Most of what I've learnt so far has been from me experimenting.</div>\n\n<div>**7\\. Throw a giant party!**</div>\n\n<div>I love organising things as you can probably tell by how elaborate our wedding was and from me helping to host our annual [Wood Party](http://admin.vikibell.com/planning-wood-party/). At some point I'd love to organise another massive party, perhaps a ball. I have a feeling this will need to wait a few years until I'm rich but it's going to happen. I'll be thirty in five years, any excuse ay?</div>\n\n<div>**8\\. Keep learning fun and strange talents**</div>\n\n<div>Okay, this is more of a mantra than a set goal. It's something I started thinking about when I signed up to a [jewellery course](http://admin.vikibell.com/making-jewellery/) and continued with improv and bouldering. I like the idea that I can have loads of different hobbies and activities to do. I'd really like to try out being one of those people at the circus who wraps themselves around in the hanging ribbon but I've got absolutely no upper body strength. Oh, and at some point I'd like to do a bartender course and learn how to flip bottles and shit.</div>\n\n<div>**9\\. Happiness**</div>\n\n<div>Happiness was my resolution for 2016 and I think I 80% achieved that. I went on some really fun holidays, had an incredible birthday and have spent time with some of my best buddies. There's been a couple of things holding me back which means that number isn't at 100% just yet. But! Big changes are about to happen so watch this space....</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>The summer after my GCSEs I went on a school trip to South Africa. It was, hands down, the best trip I’ve ever taken. We spend two and a half weeks exploring four areas of South Africa; seeing countless animals and experiencing the Zulu culture.</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Looking back now, I'm really not sure why I signed up, it didn't sound like my kind of thing at that age. I'd never done DofE or even camped outside before. My parents were convinced they were going to get a call home, two days in, with me crying about how I'd seen a spider. Luckily that wasn't the case. Fifteen year old me packed her bags and set off to South Africa without a care in the world.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We landed in Durban and stayed overnight in a camp before we split off into groups of six and meeting our guides Douwe and Sicelo. Our first stop was the St Lucia Wetlands.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**St Lucia Wetlands**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We spent three days in the wetlands and all got to know each other pretty well. I went along knowing my two friends but came back bonded with our whole group - we went through everything together, experiencing a rainbow of emotions as we went along. As we trekked through the wetlands Sicelo and Douwe told us about the animals we spotted. We saw hippos, rhinos and kudu (a type of antelope). </span>\n\n ![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSCF1822.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We carried everything we needed on our backs, including all our food, so you can imagine I was quite happy when we got to our ‘home’ for the night and dropped everything off. Home wasn’t quite as you would expect - it was a cluster of trees. Our sleeping arrangements were simple: a sleeping bag under the stars. We stayed safe from any inquisitive animals by doing 'night watch' which was where we each took turns to stay awake for an hour to keep the fire going and shine a touch around our clearing. I thought getting up for an hour each night would be difficult but as the trip went on, I appreciated the hour to myself. I kept a diary throughout the trip and it’s been amazing to look back on every few years and recall some of the serious and not so serious memories.</span>\n\n ![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/south-africa-wilderness-trail-160_2-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Imfolozi**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Next stop was Imfolozi. This was a big game park where we spent four days. To get there we all piled into a safari jeep and sung countless amounts of Disney songs along the way (YAY!). On our way into the park we spotted zebras, kudus, rhinos and a few giraffes.</span>\n\n![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC_0153-1024x681.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We made our way to home for the night and crossed a big winding river which looked like something out of the Lion King. You need to be careful when crossing the rivers there as there could be crocodiles lurking in the depths. We had to stick to the shallow sections just in case and keep an eye out. When we woke up one morning the section of the river we had crossed the evening before had a croc lounging on the banks!</span>\n\n![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC_0073-1024x681.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Speaking of which, night watch was suddenly more dangerous. One night we were camped out by a cliff and next to the river. Seeing leopards or lions etc. on the other side of the river was fine but if we heard splashing, we were in trouble! The Imfolozi was possibly my favourite section of the trip. I loved that we fell asleep to the sound of lions and baboons and that we bathed in the river every day. We also walked for hours around the plains learning more about the history of the area and the animals.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/south-africa-wilderness-trail-112-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Drakensberg Mountiains**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After the Imfolozi it was onto the Drakensberg mountains. There weren’t as many animals there, although we saw a lot of baboons on one of the days. The views were I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSCF1881.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Our home whilst in the Drakensbergs was underneath a giant rock near the top of one of the mountains. On our first day we decided to walk up to what we though looked like a rock in the shape of a bear. We also climbed inside a waterfall and spotted bushmen paintings inside rocks. After missing my daily dips in the river I decided to jump into one of the pools on top of the mountains. As you’d expect, it was freezing, refreshing but freezing!</span>\n\n![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/south-africa-wilderness-trail-210-1024x768.jpg)\n\nOn our last night in the mountains something happened. One of the rules of the trip was that you leave no trace. This includes setting fire to any toilet paper you use. As one of the girls burnt hers she accidentally dropped it and the dry grass immediately ignited. We all ran out to try and stop the fire. We’d seen areas of the mountains which had been set alight under controlled circumstances so as not to cause a wild fire. We knew the importance of putting that fire out, quickly. We battled it by pouring the little water we had on it and hitting it with our jumpers, finally managing to direct it towards a rock and extinguish. If we hadn’t acted so fast we would have been in a lot of trouble. One tiny accident could have been a catastrophe. We worked as a team to fight it off and I can remember sitting in our cave that evening with everyone coughing and spluttering but happy we had all worked together and beat the fire.\n\n![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC_0215-1024x681.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Zulu Village**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Our final stop was a Zulu village. I don’t remember where this was exactly and I can’t seem to track it down online but it was this little community we stayed with for a few nights. During the day, we visited a nearby school where we fixed up and painted the classrooms and taught the children. </span><span class=\"s1\">I can remember on our first night a little girl taught us a song. You say “I love my teddybear” twice then “I polish your shoe” as you pretend to polish someones shoe, give them a hug and then both skip around the circle whilst everyone claps.</span>\n\n![South Africa](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSCF1843.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">As I’ve been writing this post, I’ve been looking back at the diary I kept and reading all the messages from my group. One of the things that everyone commented on was how much they enjoyed everyone else’s company and how much fun we were all having together. Words can’t describe what the trip meant to me. A trip like that is something you need to experience yourself to understand. Being out in the wilderness for so long has such a calming effect. I spent my days laughing, smiling and jumping about being silly. Half of my memories were so personal to our group that they would never make it into this post. It was the best trip of my life made great by my group and our amazing guides Douwe and Sicelo. </span>\n\n_<span class=\"s1\">“The wilderness on the outside is a reflection of the wilderness on the inside” Douwe Van Der Zee, 2007\\.

      "postSlug": "hellofresh",
      "postDate": "2016-12-13 13:40:57",
      "wordpressContent": "<div>Ages ago I heard about [HelloFresh](https://www.hellofresh.co.uk/tasty/) and thought that it sounded like a great idea. Our usual routine means that we're only at home a few nights during the week so doing a big online order means some of the food gets wasted or shoved in the freezer. Using a service like HelloFresh gives us just the right ingredients to make some delicious, home cooked meals. I thought I'd give it a go when I got a voucher only to find they didn't deliver to my postcode. What?! I live in London, how do you not deliver to me? Anyway, a few months later an email appeared in my inbox saying the voucher was due to expire so I thought I'd just double check - GOOD NEWS! They now deliver to my postcode. With that I ordered a trial box.</div>\n\n<div>The process was quite simple, just click through and pick how many people you're feeding for how many meals then check out. You get a whole bunch of reminders telling you when it's all coming and even an email saying it's just been delivered! Unpacking the box was pretty cool too, I was wondering how they'd kept everything cool but there was ice blocks and big wool insulation thing in there. ![Hello Fresh](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4076-1024x755.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>For some reason we'd ended up with a family box which was two meals for four (enough for leftovers for lunch!) There were two recipe cards for a pork casserole and a chicken stir fry inside. Each detailed exactly how many ingredients to use so that you can make them again later on. They gave you just enough ingredients recipe including little sachets of apple cider vinegar and a few loose star anise for the chicken dish.</div>\n\n<div>We chose the pork casserole first as we don't often eat pork. I think this is the first time that I've followed a recipe step by step without substituting ingredients. It was super easy and only took about 40 mins to make. ![Hello Fresh](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4079-1024x683.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>I was pretty tired so didn't lay out the plates as pretty as they did on the recipe card but you get the gist. The food itself was delicious. If I saw the dish on a menu I doubt I'd ever pick it but I guess that's the good thing about having your menu chosen for you; you get to try different things. ![Hello Fresh](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4084-e1481635654612-1024x701.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>The second dish was the chicken stir fry and it was equally as delicious as the pork. I've kept both recipe cards so we can make them again. I think HelloFresh is a great idea if you don't have time to pick up ingredients or if you've run out of inspiration in the kitchen.</div>\n\n<div>![Hello Fresh](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4094-1024x784.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>This is possibly the least likely thing to happen to me seeing as I don't play the lottery and don't like gambling. Spending £2 every week could eventually accumulate to buy flights for a holiday, rather then give me the chance that I might, one day, potentially, maybe, if I'm lucky win the lottery .... I know which one I'd rather. But, it's one of those things you think about isn't it? - what would I do if I won the lottery. Well... **The second I found out I won...** I'd cash in my ticket before I did anything, I don't think I'd quite believe it otherwise. Then I'd book somewhere swanky for dinner so I could tell Charlie. Or maybe I'd buy a massive bottle of champagne and get a lobster takeaway so we could plot and plan at home. I guess it depends what night of the week it is that I found out. If it was a weekend then it would be a pretty big night! **The day or two after...** Bit disappointing as I wouldn't do anything extravagant but, I'd spend the time planning how I'd spend the money (and read through this post to see if I still agree with myself!) **The month after...** I'd pay off our mortgage and hire a project manager to help give our flat a makeover. We've got all these plans to make it even more awesome but time and money seem to get in the way. We've decorated the [lounge](http://admin.vikibell.com/decorating-tips/) and refitted the bathroom but, we _still_ need to sort out our kitchen, bedroom and hallway. Whilst the project manager is sorting out our flat, I think Charlie and I would go travelling and tick off some of the destinations on our bucket list. We'd aim to finish up somewhere like the Caribbean and would invite our family and friends out for a holiday/ party. FUN! **The year or so after...**</div>\n\n<div>Once we got back from travelling, I think I'd still be living roughly the same life as I am now just a little nicer and with more holidays. I'd still want to have a job as I like the structure in my life but, I would like more time to go on adventures, paint and create things and write this blog. I'd also make sure we did loads of the awesome events you read about in Timeout but can never afford to go to, like outrageous banquets and sky high dining.</div>\n\n<div>Finally, I'd like to give some of the money to charity but I'd tie this in with doing something really fun too. I had an amazing time at the [Jane Packer](http://admin.vikibell.com/jane-packer-foundation-flower-ball/) ball a few years ago a we raised an incredible amount of money, so perhaps I'd hold an annual event. I could pay for the entire evening and give any profit or the cost of the tickets away. That way everyone wins, money goes to the right place, a whole group of people get an amazing night and I get to organise something fun - just like I said in my [ambitions list](http://admin.vikibell.com/9-things-i-want-achieve-life/).</div>\n\n<div>**To sum it all up: throw crazy parties, go travelling/ on amazing holidays, keep some savings and live a fun life. Now I just need a lottery ticket.**</div>\n\n<div>![Champagne](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0218-1024x1024.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">Our most recent city break was to Berlin for four days. I’d found the flights earlier in the year and for £100 return for the both of us I couldn’t really say no. We both kind of forgot about the trip until the week before when we had the “oh yeah, we’re in Berlin next weekend’ realisation. We set off at stupid o'clock</span> <span class=\"s2\">on Friday morning</span> <span class=\"s1\">and flew back at an even stupider time</span> <span class=\"s2\">on Tuesday morning</span><span class=\"s1\">. Despite feeling tired from the flights I think these are my ideal timings. It means you get a full day on both sides of the holiday. </span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Day one</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We landed in Schönefeld and jumped on the train to our Airbnb in Mitte. The trains were pretty simple to work out. You can either get a ticket for one journey, one day or a week. The week ticket was €30 which worked out best for us as a day ticket was €7 each and we needed five days. After dropping off our bags we headed to Alexandraplatz to find somewhere for lunch. A random guy overheard our conversation and pointed us in the direction of a few typical German restaurants. We ordered the Berlin sausage platter and the currywurst which we shared. As well a few beers of course! </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Afterwards, we headed towards the German Christmas markets in the centre. They were nice to walk around but not great for shopping. I think we were spoilt by the markets in Munich and Nuremberg last year. We'd planned a few things to do over lunch so we jumped back on the train and headed east to Warschauer Straße. The area was like the Shoreditch of Berlin. There was a lot more street art, a lot less tourists and it felt more like true Berlin. We walked for what felt like miles (don't let Charlie be in charge of directions!) and through a pretty dodgy feeling park where I'm pretty sure you could have picked up all sorts of magical substances from the guys milling about in it. Finally, we got to where we were going.... a shopping centre. Our friend Hannah had directed us to a bar at the top which was pretty tricky to find. It's not sign posted that well and we ended up at the library on the fifth floor before we found our way through the carpark and up a ramp to Klunkerkranich. The bar was my favourite in Berlin. It had a view over the whole city (well duh, it was on top of a multi story building) and a really fun vibe to it. We grabbed a few beers and settled down in some of the seats at the back. People seemed to be having a casual evening drink or even just a cup of coffee.There was also a DJ playing some relaxing tunes too. I loved the whole atmosphere and it was exactly what I needed after a day of travelling. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0544-1024x768.jpg)Our evenings entertainment was improv. Charlie had looked up to see what the scene was like in Berlin and found a show nearby. After finishing a few drinks at Klunkerkranich, we grabbed a quick (and very cheap) dinner at a nearby pizza place called Enzos before heading to the Berlin Comedy Club. The improv was a different format to what I've seen before with loads of short form games and two teams competing against each other. The improvisers were either America, Australian or German which was fun too. I think most of the improvisers I see in London are all English so it was good to experience different senses of humour. </span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Day two</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We wanted to tick a few more Christmas markets off the list so headed to Gendarmenmarkt. On the way we stopped off at this little place for breakfast and I had bacon with cheese and scrambled eggs - YUM! It was just the right amount for breakfast and the coffee was delicious.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0551-1024x1024.jpg)The market was fun to walk around. You have to pay a euro to get in but it’s worth it as there’s a whole bunch of stalls, more than the other markets and they also have a live band.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">It was getting closer to</span> <span class=\"s2\">1pm</span> <span class=\"s1\">and we'd booked ourselves onto the alternative walking tour. I would highly recommend this if you ever visit Berlin. It’s free and takes you to some of the boroughs and explains about the street art and some of the history - without making you feel like a ridiculous tourist. We learnt about the difference between using paint or pasting printed images up - there's also a big difference in the fines you'll get if the police catch you. We also learnt a lot about gentrification throughout the tour and it was sad to see these squads or artist studios being moved on because the area was getting too expensive.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4112-1024x682.jpg)Although they tour starts in Alexandraplatz, we headed East to Ostbahnhof district where there’s more street art. We saw work by the Berlin Kidz and street art that had been made by abseiling down a building. I'd always wondered how the do it! Another technique of creating the street art is to fill a fire extinguisher with paint and use that to spray the high areas of the building. ![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0556-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We walked through the district and learnt more about the area. It covers two sides of the river and when the wall was up it was unsure who owned the bridge which connected them. Each year the citizens come out and have a massive food fight on the bridge. They throw rotten fruit and vegetables and even occasionally dirty nappies. Whoever retreats first loses the bridge for the year but the winner has to clean it all up. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I’d never looked into the reasons behind street art before, I had assumed that they were mainly due to spread a message or even because someone was just bored. There’s a lot of political messaging in the street art around Ostbahnhof but other Berlin artists create their work simply because they can. One guy paints 6 and 7's around the place for that very reason. Another, takes photos of people dancing in clubs and pastes them up on the wall surrounded by confetti in his series ‘_Time to Dance_’.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">There are also rules about painting over each other's street art. There's been various frauds and fights when someone has gone over the top of someone's work. Street art is only semi permanent, what I saw on the tour might not be there next week. Work disappears because it’s been either been painted over by the government or by another street artists. One of the rules of painting over someone's work is that you need to take into consideration the time and money they spent on it. The higher value it is, the less acceptable it is to paint over it.![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4114-1024x683.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The tour lasted three hours and I feel like I’ve only touched the surface of street art knowledge.</span> <span class=\"s1\">As the tour finished up in Ostbahnhof we asked our guide where she’d recommend for dinner. Funnily enough it was near to Warschauer Straße where we’d gotten off the day before. We jumped on the train for one stop over and found a place off a road called Simon-Dach-Straße. I think we were still pretty exhausted from all the travelling and walking we did so had a fairly relaxed dinner and headed back to our Airbnb to catch up on our ZZZ’s.</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Day three</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We woke up to rain - yuck. Feeling refreshed after a big sleep, I was ready to hit the ground running and tour Berlin like never before. Except for the rain. We tried not to let it bring us down so grabbed breakfast and walked along to the Brandenburg gate and the Holocaust memorial. As we arrived at each place I pulled up some of the travel guides and read out the history of them. The scale of the Holocaust memorial was incredible. It was designed by Peter Eisenman and the blocks are meant to create an uneasy and confusing atmosphere - it did exactly that.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0568-1024x804.jpg)We had another walk around the Christmas markets before being defeated by the rain. Charlie’s favourite place in Munich is the Hufbrauhaus and seeing as there was one in Berlin, it seemed rude not to pop in. And by pop in I mean we were in there for about five hours. Opps. I love the atmosphere in beerhalls. It seemed like a lot of locals headed there with their families for Sunday lunch. The place was packed when we entered with elderly couples and children spinning around on the dance floor. As our Steins arrived the band started playing the Viki song which literally went “oh Viki, Viki, Viki Viki’ - errrr hello?!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4119-1024x683.jpg)After a long time in a beerhall we thought it was a good idea to do a pub crawl. I don’t usually like pub crawls. They’re full of rowdy men looking to sink pints and move on. As well as the walking tour the alternative group offered a pub crawl which showed some of the more unique Berlin hangouts. We started off in a little bar called Yesterdays before going to a craft beer bar called the [<span class=\"s3\">Monterey Bar</span>](https://twitter.com/montereybar). I picked the Berliner Berg and Charlie chose the Nogine O. both were really nice although at 10% I think I preferred the Nogine O.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Feeling a little merry from the copious amounts of drinks, we went to an underground ping pong club. In true Berlin style it was through a door with no sign post and was full of graffiti. There was a game of about ten people playing ping pong, each walking around the table until it was their turn to hit it. If you were out, you were out and if you made it to the final two, things got pretty intense. The beer here was from their own micro-brewery so we grabbed a few bottles and settled down to watch the games. This was the best place we went to I think as it seemed like you were chilling in someones games room, rather than a bar.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0595-1024x768.jpg)Next stop was an absinthe bar where they had a ridiculous amount of different types of it from all over the world. Our last stop was a club which was very very quiet for Berlin. It was a Sunday night though and having been drinking for hours I wasn’t in the mood for something too energetic. The pub crawl was fun to try out but I wouldn’t recommend it - you’d be able to look up similar bars and clubs yourself and save the €12\\.</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Day four</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We were feeling extremely tired from the previous night but I wanted to make sure I didn’t miss anything out. We went out for the perfect hangover cure - pizza, then made our way across to see the East Side Gallery.![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0617-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is a big expanse of the Berlin wall which has been decorated by artists. There was various political messages as well as paintings which simply aimed to be pretty. We walked along the wall for a while before doubling back. It’s quite a nice walk and really shows the size of the wall. There were quite a few tourists around though so be prepared to dodge them taking photos.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After we went to RAW-Gelände which I really wanted to see during the day. At night it’s a place with bars and clubs but there’s a really feel of artist community there. Not to mention I love abandoned and run-down buildings - I’m strange, I know.![Berlin](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0619-1024x768.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">My last Berlin activity was to go and see the Reichstag Building. I know a few people that have been up it but I wasn’t too worried about going inside. You need to get a ticket from a place across the road and when I got there the only tickets were for the next day. Not being too worried, I walked all the way around the outside instead before heading back home.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I feel like we managed to fit quite a lot into our four days in Berlin. We weren’t too worried about going to the museums or the tourist hotspots and instead just wanted to experience the culture and learn more about the current city. It has an amazing feel to it whether you go for tourists reasons or to experience their insane nightlife.</span>",

      "wordpressContent": "After spotting the posters on the tube a few months ago I really wanted to see the Abstract Expressionism exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art. It's a movement which heavily influenced my work at uni, not to mention that it was one of the biggest art movements of the twentieth century. This was the first time the big names such a<span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';\">s Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko had all ha</span>d work displayed together.\n\n<div>Walking around the exhibitions rooms reignited my love for exploring artwork and visiting galleries. I used to pop along to various exhibitions whilst I was at uni but it seems to have dropped off my radar since. I always recall a school trip to the National Gallery where we were dragged around, completely uninterested in the work - I think my highlight of the trip was buying a pencil in the shop at the end. Visiting a museum or gallery is far more satisfying when you can take the time to appreciate the artwork and understand the reasons behind it. As I walked around the Royal Academy, I was intently listening to the audio guide learning more about the reasons behind the seemingly random paintings.</div>\n\n<div>A lot of the artwork was created using partially planned spontaneity. The artist might have known the types of marks they wanted to make on the page but they didn't know the end result. Things were left to chance and they trusted themselves to make the work great. On first inspection the paintings look uncontrolled and unplanned but once you look closely you can see how the artists have worked back into their creations.</div>\n\n<div>The principle of improvisation was central to Abstract Expressionism. This links through into the popular music at the time as well - jazz. Whilst not all the artists were interested or influenced by jazz, you can spot a lot of similarities between the art and the improvised jazz solos. This got me thinking about how one hobby can influence you in everything you do. When painting is always improvised my end result. Even when working from photographs I never want a painting to look the same - what's the point? My love improvising my paintings explains a lot about how much I enjoyed my improv comedy course last year.</div>\n\n<div>This blog post has gone off on quite a bit of a tangent and I guess this bunch of ramblings is more for me than anyone else. What I'm trying to say is that you should try and visit a museum/ exhibition soon and take the time to think about and appreciate whatever it shows you. Think about it in relation to your life and see if there is anything you can learn from it.</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">A few weeks ago Charlie and I were sat in Stansted airport, waiting for our flight to Berlin and wishing the waiter would hurry up and take our order. We started thinking about how awesome it would be to have an iPad so you could order whenever you want instead of having to wait. The guys over at [Inamo](http://www.inamo-restaurant.com/) must have read my mind as an email landed in my inbox inviting me to the Camden opening. The email described a little bit about them and, well, you guessed it … they use iPads to order! Each table comes with an iPad so you can scroll through the pretty pictures of food and drinks, pick what you want and order it straight from there.</span>\n\n![Inamo](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WhatsApp-Image-2017-01-10-at-22.17.03-1-855x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">But wait…. there's more! If you don't want to use iPads you can always order using the table as they have interactive projections on there too. Pretty swanky you say? Well, they also have games you can play, a camera so you can spy on the chef, the option to change the table background and even a drawing app but I'll get to that later. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Intrigued by the tech as well as the promise of delicious Asian fusion food, I headed along to the Camden opening. The new restaurant is just opposite Mornington Crescent station and a short walk down from Camden market. I arrived to a champagne and sushi reception on the roof terrace which was surprisingly warm and didn't at all feel like London. I can't remember the last time we ate sushi out but it was delicious.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Inamo](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4200-1024x683.jpg)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then it was play time! We headed inside for a caricature drawing lesson and [David](http://grovescartoons.co.uk/) (our teacher) had already sketched out some of us. Can you spot me?</span> <span class=\"s1\">![Inamo](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4202-1024x683.jpg)It was then our turn to sketch out our faces. We had a quick run through of how it works and luckily I got the hang of it pretty quickly. You can pick shades of colour and different mark marking tools like spray paint, pen or some patterny thing. I’m pretty bad at drawing people so instead ended up doodling a little octopus and me under the sea. It should totally be on display at the Tate - right?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Inamo](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4208-1024x683.jpg) I went into my own little world whilst I was doodling, I could sit and do that for hours. Perhaps it isn’t the best place to take me for dinner if you actually want a conversation? I almost missed the food turning up but I’m so glad I didn’t; everything was A M A Z I N G!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Inamo](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4211-1024x696.jpg) My favourite dishes were the Char Sui Buns (tiny clouds of goodness), Korean chicken wings and the crazy amount of sushi we had to begin with.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">![Inamo](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4218-1024x683.jpg) The food and the tech in Inamo has me already planning to go back. Although, the only issue is that I’d want to order everything on the menu!!</span>\n\n*Thanks to [Erica](http://www.imbeingerica.com/) for the pic of me.\n\n**I was a guest of Inamo but the food and drawing was so good I just had to tell you about it!",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">February holds a few key dates for Charlie and I. There's Valentines on the 14th, the 15th was the day he proposed to me two years ago and the 16th was the first time he asked me to be his girlfriend. Ten years ago. Because of that we tend to roll everything into one big anniversary and do something special on the 16th. Do people still celebrate their dating anniversary when they're married? Well we do. Anyway, ten years is a bloody long time and we've done a hell of a lot. It was time to crunch the numbers so I sat down with my calculator and have worked out (roughly) how many things have happened in that time. Don't worry, I've shown my workings so you can try it too!</span>\n\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Days we’ve been ‘an item’: 3,650</span>\n    *   <span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Counting the day Charlie first asked me out until 16th February 2017</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Minutes we’ve been together: 5,256,000</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Days spent together: 2,336</span>\n    *   <span class=\"s1\">Based on us seeing each other everyday since we moved in together in September 2009, an average of a weekend spent together every three weeks at uni, the schools days together and estimates of time we spent together in the holidays</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Photos taken: 47,000</span>\n    *   <span class=\"s1\">Based on the amount of photos I’ve taken in ten years, not including Charlie’s</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Photos of us together: 2,300</span>\n    *   <span class=\"s1\">I have 1,500 on my laptop but there are quite a few Charlie has as well as all the ones everyone else has</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Amount spent on presents for each other: £2,500</span>\n    *   <span class=\"s1\">Based on ten years of Christmas and birthday presents at around £50-100</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Smiles: 27,000 </span>\n    *   <span class=\"s1\">Based on us smiling around ten times everyday we are with each other plus one smile for everyday we have been together</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Hangovers: 628</span>\n    *   <span class=\"s1\">Based on one hangover for one of us per weekend for each week we’ve seen each other.

Charlie and I bring out the best in each other. We're constantly messing about or planning silly ideas. In fact, my how to survive a zombie apocalypse post stems from an extremely long pub conversation we had. We've also learnt a lot about each other and been there through the tears and the tantrums (okay that's just me!). So here's a few of my tips for being happy living with someone: </span>\n\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Listen to each other</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Say yes more often than you say no. It makes things more fun and that thing that you didn’t really feel like doing could just turn out to be awesome!</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Laughing and being silly can cure everything</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Say what you’re feeling. If something is stressing you out then just say it. The other person probably hasn’t noticed that they’re doing something wrong</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Cuddle</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Make mundane things fun. The other day I was making fish for dinner so decided to make a fish themed playlist, turn on blue lighting (that's Hue!) and dress up like a fish for when Charlie got home. See? Fun!</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">Plan time to do exciting things together. Even if it’s just a walk in the park or taking board games down the pub on a Sunday afternoon</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A few of my favourite memories from the past ten years:</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">It’s too hard to pick a favourite so here’s a few random memories which made me smile:</span>\n\n1.  <span class=\"s1\">The time we adopted a mummified skeleton called Frankie</span>\n2.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we had a picnic on the floor of our flat whilst listening to bird song youtube clips because the park was shut</span>\n3.  <span class=\"s1\">That time I dressed up as a whore and Charlie had a dead bird on his head for the Movember Gala</span>\n4.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we got super drunk on a cooking course and went gift list shopping in John Lewis</span>\n5.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we pranked Facebook by saying we got married and Charlie’s cousin called up his sister</span>\n6.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we actually got married</span>\n7.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we painted our wedding table plan in the woods</span>\n8.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we woke up drunk and bought our lounge carpet</span>\n9.  <span class=\"s1\">That time I came home and Charlie had put on the Gandalf video in every single room of the house and hid</span>\n10.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we went out with Charlie’s dad to celebrate our first anniversary, drunk two bottles of wine, a magnum of champagne and a bottle of prosecco and then went to an improv class</span>\n11.  <span class=\"s1\">That time we turned up in Ghent to a massive street festival and I won a mask by doing the limbo</span>\n\n![Viki & Charlie](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SSL222412-768x1024.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "I quite often get to a stage where I have no idea what to make for dinner. It’s pretty easy to make the same few recipes every week but it gets boring quickly. To keep track of our favourite recipes and to make sure we’re mixing up our meals, Charlie and I are working on a two week mini project to make a cookbook. It’s not going to be the world's most refined, buy it in a book shop kind of thing but it’ll be something we can flick through and decide on dinner with. I’ll transfer some of the recipes into posts so I can share them with you guys too. The first one I'm sharing is my honey and JD beef.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I’d been making beef burritos quite a lot but I didn’t know what else you could do with beef chunks. Apart from the obvious casserole but I’m not a massive fan of that. I had a quick Google and found a few recipes which I mixed together to create this one. Enjoy.</span>\n\n![Honey and JD Beef](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4812-950x1024.jpg)\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Ingredients (this makes enough for two)</span>**\n\n*   <span class=\"s1\">40ml honey</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">30ml brown sugar</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">40ml Jack Daniels</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">30ml Soy sauce</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">30ml worchester sauce</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">1 clove of garlic</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">half a fresh chilli</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">400g diced beef</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">1 tablespoon of oil</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">1 tablespoon of butter</span>\n\n![Honey and JD Beef](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4861-798x1024.jpg)\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Method</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Whisk together all the honey, sugar, JD, worchester sauce, garlic, chilli and oil. Add the beef and make sure it’s well coated. Then put that all in the fridge for at least two hours.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Next, melt the butter in a frying pan and add the beef mixture. You don’t want to cook this for too long else it’ll be too chewy and dry. Literally seal the edges then serve. If you have any sauce leftover you can thicken it up with a little flour and pour it over the top.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">It’ll end up looking like a big sticky mess but trust me, it’s delicious! I served it with green beans and a bean dish. ![Honey & JD Beef](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_4875-1024x683.jpg)</span>",

      "wordpressContent": "I try to live by the idea that I will say yes to things more than no and that I’ll try anything once. This thinking is how I ended up at the theatre this week about to see The Girls, a musical I knew next to nothing about except that it’s based on the real life story of Calendar Girls, a film I am still yet to see, and it’s a ‘musical comedy’ written by Gary Barlow and Tim Firth. On paper it sounds a bit too girly for me but in reality I really enjoyed the show. Turning up I felt a little out of place. Everyone seems to be on the other side of thirty onwards and I started to wonder if I should have brought my mum along instead of my mate! As the first act begun those thoughts evaporated and I found myself tapping my feet to the music, giggling at the jokes and having a really lovely time. It was a very girly show but it was light hearted and a feel good musical that can easily be enjoyed by anyone, especially the gentleman behind me who was in hysterics throughout the performance. I haven't been to a musical in ages but I forgot how much I enjoy them. The music didn't disappoint either, there was a mixture of sad, funny and uplifting songs which got the balance just right. Also, I love it when an actress stands in the middle of the stage alone belting out lyrics. Power ballad anyone? The standing ovation at the end was very well deserved. The cast were so happy to be performing and you could tell that they enjoyed every single minute of it, they were all in such high spirits. If you’d like to see The Girls for yourself then it is on at the Phoenix Theatre until 22nd April and you can book tickets from the [Box Office](http://www.boxoffice.co.uk/arts-and-theatre-tickets/musicals/the-girls-tickets.aspx). ![The Girls](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_0546-1024x765.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "Everyday for the past two months I’ve been eating the same [breakfast](https://food.vikibell.com/recipe/eggy-mess/). Obviously my body wasn’t as keen on it as I was and I became allergic to eggs. Annoying. I’ve cut them out of my diet completely with the hope that I can re-introduce them later on but, it’s left me struggling for breakfast ideas as most things contain eggs or carbs or milk (which I didn’t want to eat/ I don't like). It was a little tricky until I found chickpea pancakes and then, a few days later, lentil pancakes. #Winning\n\n<span class=\"s1\">These recipes have been adapted from a [Jamie Oliver](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/chickpea-flour-pancakes-with-salad-chutney/) one (chickpeas) and [Healthy Little Foodies](https://healthylittlefoodies.com/lentil-spinach-pancakes/) (lentils). As usual I didn’t have all the ingredients so I made a few changes. You’ll notice that they are pretty similar recipes but both delicious in their own way.</span>\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Chickpea pancakes</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Ingredients</span>\n\n*   <span class=\"s1\">300g dried chickpeas soaked overnight</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">½ teaspoon ground cumin</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">½ teaspoon ground coriander</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">olive oil</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Toppings:</span>\n\n*   <span class=\"s1\">1 red onion</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">1 tomato</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">1 handful of spinach</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">salsa</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">guacamole</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Method</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Soak the chickpeas in water overnight or for a minimum of eight hours. The next morning drain them and pop in a food processor with the herbs and around 100- 200ml of water. I tend to add this in a little at a time as I don’t want the batter to be too watery. Blend until everything is nice and smooth.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Heat olive oil in a small frying pan or wok. Make sure it’s nice and hot before turning the heat to medium and adding the batter. You’re supposed to add this in batches but every time I’ve made these I’ve just added it all in at once and made a giant pancake.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Swirl the pan to make sure the liquid is spread evenly and leave to fry for around three minutes. Then it’s time to flip it! Sometimes it breaks apart a little but once flipped it’ll stick back together. Leave to fry for a few minutes whilst in a separate pan you fry off a red onion, tomato and spinach to serve on top of the pancake alongside guacamole and salsa.</span>\n\n![Chickpea pancakes](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Chickpea-pancakes1-1024x768.jpg)\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Lentil pancakes</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Ingredients</span>\n\n*   <span class=\"s1\">300g dried green lentils soaked overnight</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">2 cloves garlic</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">¼ teaspoon ground cumin</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">¼ teaspoon turmeric</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">½ teaspoon paprika</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">1 handful of spinach</span>\n*   <span class=\"s1\">olive oil</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Method</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Soak the lentils in water overnight or for a minimum of eight hours. The next morning drain them and add them with the herbs and around 100-200ml water into a food processor. Again, add the water in slowly as you don’t want it to be too watery. Blend until smooth. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">As you heat up some olive oil in a pan, chop the spinach. Add in the batter and sprinkle the spinach on top. Leave this to fry for around five minutes on a medium heat. After five minutes/ when it’s less watery on top, flip the pancake and leave to fry for another five minutes on that side. I’ve made this twice and both times I’ve got a bit distracted doing other things so have ended up leaving it cooking on a low heat for an extra five minutes, this is good if you want the outside slightly crispier.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I served mine with bacon and salsa and a rather large cup of coffee.</span>\n\n![Lentil pancakes](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Lentil-pancakes-1024x768.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>Secret Cinema Moulin Rouge? Errr yes please! As soon as I found out this was the next instalment of Secret Cinema I booked tickets for Charlie and I as Christmas presents. On Christmas Day I gave him a box which contained a suspended belt (hilarious to open in front of his family) and a pretty rubbish photoshop of our faces as Satine and Christian. It's one of our favourite films so we were super excited but didn't know what to expect.</div>\n\n<div>![Moulin Rouge](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MR-683x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Everything to do with Secret Cinema had been thought out thoroughly, from the detail on the various websites, the back stories to our characters and even their social media presence. So what do you need to expect and prepare for a secret cinema event? Well, I'm not going to spoil the surprise by going into too much detail (that's the whole point isn't it? the secret) but these are some general tips for preparing for an immersive event.</div>\n\n<div>**Stick to the rules**</div>\n\n<div>Part of the appeal of Secret Cinema is that it's secret. Don't go and blab about it afterwards on social media as you'll ruin it for everyone. If you had a great time then post a pic of your outfit and say that you had an amazing time.</div>\n\n<div>**Immerse yourself in the experience**</div>\n\n<div>Embrace the immersive aspect of Secret Cinema and get fully consumed by your role. If you are supposed to be a confident character then play that, if you're supposed to be pretty shady then play that too. If you're asked any questions whilst inside then make sure you reply in character. Trust me, you'll enjoy it a whole lot more.</div>\n\n<div>**Plan your outfit**</div>\n\n<div>A month before our booking we were emailed a secret code and assigned our characters, I immediately jumped onto my laptop to plan my outfit. I spent a day at my nan's house with her and her sewing machine creating my skirt. It was a lot more fun than buying one off the shelf and I got to make it look exactly how I wanted. I forgot to plan my hair and makeup until the day though which meant I spent the entire afternoon playing around with it. Make sure you think about your whole look as hair and makeup makes a biiiiiig difference to any outfit.</div>\n\n<div>**Plan your travel**</div>\n\n<div>When you get the top secret location make sure you plan your route! Especially if you're wearing slightly strange clothes. I had two options to get there and although walking to the overground was a few mins quicker, I didn't fancy walking down the street alone wearing a corset and can can skirt, so I got the tube instead.</div>\n\n<div>**Be prepared to feel a bit silly**</div>\n\n<div>From the second you walk out the house. I talking about the fact that I had to get the tube, alone, in rush hour. One woman couldn't stop staring at me and shooting me the evil look before she moved to the other side of the tube.</div>\n\n<div>**Enjoy it**</div>\n\n<div>I paid attention to eeeeeverything that happened to make sure I could remember it all. As soon as we got inside we walked around everything and took it all in. I wanted to make sure I'd seen everything and explored it all before I let go and enjoyed the night. Those memories will stay with me forever. Everyone was so happy and friendly!</div>\n\n<div>That's everything I can say on [Secret Cinema](https://www.secretcinema.org/) but trust me, it's amazing. If you get a chance to get tickets then do so! It's well worth it.</div>\n\n<div>![Secret Cinema](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Secret-Cinema1-1024x853.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>Coming home from work, cooking dinner and discussing your day gets a bit repetitive doesn't it? That kind of thinking is how I found myself sat crossed legged on the floor in blue light cutting out cardboard shapes the other week.</div>\n\n<div>I had a bit of spare time on my hands and didn't fancy doing anything ... so I planned dinner. I love cooking and one of my favourite meals at the moment is Thai salmon. It's basically a massive salmon fillet cooked with green curry paste and coconut oil then served with garlic leeks, courgettes and grilled cabbage. Okay, now I'm hungry....</div>\n\n<div>As I begun preparing the food I started humming the song from the Little Mermaid and a theme started to develop in my head. Before I knew it the fish was in the oven, I was scouring the internet for songs about fish and adding them to a playlist aptly named Fish Day. And so Fish Day was born. After putting a few of my favourite songs on including The Salmon Dance by <a dir=\"ltr\">Chemical Brothers</a>, Car Wash (the theme from Sharks Tale) and Under the Sea from <a dir=\"ltr\">the Little Mermaid,</a> I realised that there weren't actually all that many songs about fish. I branched out a little to a wider theme of the sea and added on Seven Seas of Rhye by Queen and I'm on a Boat by Lonely Island and a few others.</div>\n\n<div>With fifteen minutes to go until Charlie arrived home the race was on to complete the now, self proclaimed, best Fish Day the world had ever seen. My attention turned to the lighting and more specifically the Philips Hue bulbs, my trusty alley in all themed evenings, I set all the lights in the house to a deep blue colour and was satisfied. This did make checking on the food incredibly difficult but it was for the good of Fish Day.</div>\n\n<div>Time was ticking as I dashed out into the hallway remembering the cardboard I'd set aside for recycling. I spotted the cutting mat and a scalpel left carelessly on the workbench and got to work cutting out fish shapes and threading them through some string. With a few minutes a to spare I created my final addition to Fish Day, a fish mask. Cutting the shape, adding in detail with felt tip and attaching it to my face was done with lightning speed.</div>\n\n<div>Music? Set. Lights? Set. Costume? Set. I was in position and ready to see Charlie's reaction as he came through the door. His initial confusion was apparent. I soon realised that he had no idea what we were having for dinner so his wife waving bits of cardboard around whilst wearing a oddly snapped piece of cardboard on her face which had apparently been coloured in by a toddler made very little sense. ![Fish Day2](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fish-Day2-1022x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Overall though, the first annual Fish Day was a success. The atmosphere was alive with fishy vibes and it was a lot of fun for a seemingly average <a dir=\"ltr\">Thursday evening</a>. How did you celebrate fish day 2017?</div>",

      "postSlug": "introduction-improv-comedy",
      "postDate": "2017-04-02 14:10:44",
      "wordpressContent": "<div>I first found out about improv comedy during a startup event called F*ck Up Night. Various people took to the stage to explain how they messed up their startup or their biggest failure in life. Two people mentioned how they took improv comedy courses so they could improve their confidence and presentability. With that, Charlie was off booking himself on a course and after hearing all about it from him, I copied and and booked myself on one too. Last July was my first eight week course and it took place in a school on a Monday evening. I spent the time pretending to be various characters and jumping about like a child. It’s safe to say that I got the improv bug. I’ve just finished my second course with my first performance in front of a real life audience this week. Eek!</div>\n\n<div>Improv is amazing for getting you to think differently. I feel a lot more creative, confident and energised after a session and it really isn't that difficult to try out! There are plenty of drop in sessions around London but if you want give it a go at home there's a few things to consider:</div>\n\n<div>**Always have fun**</div>\n\n<div>Number one rule. If it isn’t fun then why would you do it? More importantly if you aren’t having fun, the audience won’t have fun either.</div>\n\n<div>**Yes and **</div>\n\n<div>Always accept someones idea or premise and build upon it, no matter how silly or unlikely it is. If your scene partner tells you that you are both glue fairies, then for the rest of the scene you are both glue fairies. Who know's what glue fairies are but this is your chance to define them.</div>\n\n<div>**Who, what, where **</div>\n\n<div>A scene gets going a lot quicker once the audience knows the basic information. Always try and fit in who a person is (use names), what your relationship is too them and where you are within the first few lines. It makes everything easier to follow and paves way for more of a fun dialogue.</div>\n\n<div>**Be positive **</div>\n\n<div>Similar to the \"yes and\" rule, try to be positive in a scene. It's often easier to work with the audience (and improvisers) and they will have a lot more fun if the characters are nice to each other. Try to use lines like 'that's what I like about you'.</div>\n\n<div>With this in mind I’m going to try and share a few short games with you over the next few weeks. The first one is one of the first games I played. We were sat around the dinner table and everyone had a go at joining in. The first time might be a little tricky but give it a go with two friends and see how you get on.</div>\n\n<div>**New choice **</div>\n\n<div>New choice is a pretty simple but fun game to play. Two people begin a conversation inspired by a random word from the audience. The third person is on the sidelines and is able to shout out 'new choice' whenever they want to 'edit' the scene. For example:</div>\n\n<div>Improviser 1: Oh goodness Amy, you’re covered in mud. Don’t get it on the kitchen floor!</div>\n\n<div>Improviser 2: Sorry daddy, I just wanted to touch the fluffy sheep</div>\n\n<div>Director: New choice</div>\n\n<div>Improviser 2: Sorry daddy, I was trying to hide from the goats</div>\n\n<div>Director:: New choice</div>\n\n<div>Improviser 2: The sheep field is so fun. It's where I come to reflex on the important things in life like the existence of toast.</div>\n\n<div>Director: New choice of object</div>\n\n<div>Improviser: Like the existence of flamingos</div>\n\n<div>Improviser 1: ahh, I see. Contemplating the existence of flamings is very important..... etc.</div>\n\n<div>Take a look at this video to find out more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFDJtUmIcmM</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">At the beginning of the year I heard about an app called [Habitica](https://habitica.com) which helps you organise your life. I often have a million things running through my head but this little app is a great way to keep track of them and making sure they actually get done. Like most apps I was a bit sceptical that I'd do it for a few weeks and then forget about it but, four months on and I'm still going strong. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Habitica is basically a habit tracking app which has gamifies mundane tasks. Once signing up you get a little avatar and can advance to new levels with the more habits you tick. Some of mine include things that I know I should really do like make the bed (don't judge!) and meditation. Since using the app I've found myself making more time for important things like taking ten minutes out for myself, eating healthily and doing exercise (even if I have added the option of one sit-up, because everyone needs a hangover day let off right?)  </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The more tasks you tick off the higher level you reach but also.... you get pets! As you tick things off you'll randomly find eggs, potions to hatch them and food to evolve them into mounts that your avatar can ride. Awesome! </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You can also use the app to keep track of your to do list and habits you want to form (but not do everyday) like reading a book. These give you extra points the longer you're on there and the habits are able to be ticked every time you do them. Oh, and you can add in negative ones which take away your health if you do them - one of mine is drinking too much which I've ticked slightly more times that I would have liked but at least I'm thinking about it right? </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Habitica is great for keeping track of the things I do everyday and rewarding me for doing them. Suddenly cleaning the bathroom or putting a wash on seems so much more appealing knowing that I'll score points for doing it. Like most apps I was a bit sceptical that I'd do it for a few weeks and then forget about it but, four months on and I'm still going strong. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Have you signed up to [Habitica](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/habitica-gamified-task-manager/id994882113?mt=8)? Let's be buddies, add my user ID: </span><span class=\"s2\">e12fc81a-735f-4a0f-a57e-c5a807e7581a </span>\n\n![Habitica Avatar](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Habitica-Avatar-1024x299.jpg)",

      "postSlug": "fake-bloggers",
      "postDate": "2017-04-23 10:38:40",
      "wordpressContent": "<div>Before I start this post, as much as I'd like to be coming at this from a blogger point of view, I'm not. This blog post has been written with my PR/ social hat on. Take it or leave it but these are my thoughts.</div>\n\n<div>After reading [Jess, The Travelista's post](http://thetravelista.net/2017/04/19/an-open-letter-to-pr-professionals/), I've been thinking about why PRs would work with 'fake' bloggers. A fake blogger is someone who uses bots or tactics to inflate their social followers or engagements. Every word of Jess's post it true and it's an extremely valuable read to anyone wanting to work with bloggers. However, I wanted to add one little bit. The clients and the fee. I don't condone using 'fake' bloggers at all. Ever. But I can see why some PRs do and why for some it's out of their control.</div>\n\n<div>A while ago I researched a blogger that was highly recommended by a colleague only to find that she does follow unfollow. It was pretty obvious by a new social account she'd set up which suddenly had tens of thousands of followers but only a few posts. I was disappointed but there was nothing I could do. I'd been instructed to outreach to her. Why did I do it? Because no matter how much I push back on PRs or clients, if they want a certain blogger then they'll have it. It's their budget and if they want to throw it away on fake engagement that's up to them, as long as I've made it clear that it's a waste there's nothing more I can do.</div>\n\n<div>Another reason some PRs may use fake bloggers is that it takes too long to check every single person they find for a big campaign. Time is money and over-servicing is always an issue within PR. Finding bloggers is a time consuming task by itself. Facebook groups like U.K. Bloggers that allow you to post opportunities on are great (and thanks team for everything you moderate on there!) but, PRs aren't always allowed to post details about the campaign. Making lists of bloggers to approach usually has to be a manual task or you have to work from existing lists or relationships. Clients don't want to have to fork out an extra Xk for their PRs to sense check bloggers even more than they're already doing (I wrote about what I look for [here](https://vikibell.com/posts/prs-look-bloggers/)). It all takes time and when a lot of bloggers don’t respond to emails, you tend to have to build bigger lists than you need.</div>\n\n<div>Sometimes it's impossible to find the right bloggers for the niche you need. Trust me. I've had to find a needle in a haystack more often than I would have liked. Imagine how difficult it is to find a pregnant blogger living in Manchester who doesn't have any children yet and has over 20K followers on each social account. Oh, and hasn't spoken about any competitor in the past six months. It's difficult okay?</div>\n\n<div>I don't think fake bloggers should be used on any campaign ever. I'll always put in extra work to make sure I don't work with any but, I guess what I'm trying to say is that finding true, relevant bloggers to work on a client campaign is long hard work which usually needs to be done in half the time it should take.</div>\n\n<div>Some PR's put a lot of time into finding good bloggers. Sometimes it's near impossible to find someone in the time limit, budget or niche that you're looking for. Bloggers .... don't get pulled into the trap of counting followers and comparing yourself to others. Be yourself. Be genuine. You'll be noticed and, if you're not, just message a PR and ask to meet for a coffee to talk about how you can start working with them.</div>",

      "postSlug": "getting-into-fitness",
      "postDate": "2017-04-30 12:22:26",
      "wordpressContent": "<div>I've always wanted that I care more about my fitness and be motivated to go for a run or do a class or something (anything!). At school I tried things like hockey, netball and tennis but I just wasn't very good. I stuck to athletics and swimming but even then I used to just go along when I was free, or get told about a swimming gala the night before. It's pretty safe to say that fitness isn't a big thing for me.</div>\n\n<div>That kind of sentence always gets followed up by a 'until now' type statement doesn't it? Well.... nah. Fitness has become a little bit more important to me this year but it's not something that drives me. Having a couple of months off work (I quit my job at the end of last year but that's totally another story) meant that I had a whole lot of time to try out new things. And, as it turns out, there's a whole bunch of things you can try out in London for FREE!</div>\n\n<div>**Psycle **</div>\n\n<div>Spin class? I was dreading it. Everyone had told me that the classes were hard and sweaty - why do they go back?! Going along with my cousin [Sarah](https://cleverwellness.wordpress.com/) who just so happens to be an amazing personal trainer, nutritionist and fitness junkie didn't help the matter either. But ... I had a free pass, had signed up and I was going to give it a go. I'd even told myself that if I couldn't do it I would just walk out the class. Simple.</div>\n\n<div>Good news: I did it and I enjoyed it so much I did another class a few weeks later. Spin really isn't as hard as you think, the instructors are awesome and are insanely motivational. I pretty much felt like I could win Tour de France by the time I came out of there. And the good thing is that the bikes have their own level of difficulty (adjusting the resistance of the pedals) so if I found it too difficult, I just made it a little easier... and still felt like I was keeping up with Sarah!</div>\n\n<div>**Hot Pod Yoga **</div>\n\n<div>Yoga is perhaps the best thing I discovered during my fitness flurry and it's the thing I've continued at home. I'd tried out hot yoga before at [Fitness First](https://vikibell.com/posts/hot-yoga-class) but this was [hot pod yoga](http://hotpodyoga.com/) - inside a big inflatable pod. Hot Pod yoga was a <a dir=\"ltr\">Saturday evening</a> class I signed up for and I've since been four other times to their Brixton Pod.</div>\n\n<div>My initial worry with hot yoga is that it would be too hot. I'm not very good in saunas or steam rooms so I had visions of me passing out on the mat or something. It wasn't like that at all. The pod was a comfortable 37 degrees, perfect for relaxing your muscles without being unbearable. The instructors make sure to come around and correct your positions too which I found super helpful - I just can't get my heels on the ground during downward dog!</div>\n\n<div>![Viki yoga](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Viki-yoga.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>**Running with Nike **</div>\n\n<div>I'd previously been using this [app](http://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/c/nike-plus/running-app-gps) to measure the miles on any long walks I did. Because, you know, walking is pretty much the same as running yeah? Well, anyway... Last year I went on the longest run of my life. Fuelled by shots of Patron from the previous nights I got up early and ran up to Alexandra Palace and then for brunch in Muswell Hill. This was the first time I used the app but it made me more excited for running.</div>\n\n<div>It's ridiculously obvious but you can see so much more by running to places. I shocked myself by going for an early morning run in Tenerife and saw so many other runners. I've also started to try and incorporate it with tasks I need to do. The other day I needed to pick up my glasses from Angel so ended up running down all the pretty roads around there. Anytime I got to a road that looked sweet I detoured slightly and went down it. It was a lovely start to the day and I got to see more of the area.</div>\n\n<div>I'd still like to try out aerial yoga, rave aerobics and trapeze so if anyone has any recommendations, shoot them my way!</div>\n\n<div>![Viki run](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Viki-run-1024x769.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "I’ve packed in a lot of mini fun things last month so I’ve decided to start sharing end of month roundups as a bit of a way of tracking things I do. Here’s a few fun moments from April.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Improv**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">At the beginning of the month I had my first ever improv show! I’ve been doing improv for a while now but this was the first time I’d actually been on stage, in front of an audience, under real stage lights. EEK! The good news is that it went well! I was literally buzzing with excitement beforehand and had a load of people come out to watch and support me. The atmosphere was electric and everyone was so so so happy to be there. One of my favourite scenes was when I owned a llama farm and our neighbour was trying to steal them, oh, or maybe it was the one where I was flirting with a guy in a comic book store…. I guess if you take that out of context it sounds a bit strange but anyway, it was fun and we got a lot of laughs which was good!</span>\n\n![improv](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/improv-1024x683.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Easter**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Easter weekend was a jam packed four days of fun. We did _everything_ - which you could probably tell from my Instagram story if you follow me (plug!). One Friday we went to the wood and learnt some circus skills before playing tennis and going to the pub. On Saturday we took the boat to the pub, had lunch and a few beers, went rowing on the boating lake and then to the pub. On Sunday we had a dip in the sea, and Easter egg hunt, a game of tennis and then (you guessed it), went to the pub. On Monday we ate fish and chips on the beach before the drive back to London.</span>\n\n![Swimming in Suffolk](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Swimming-in-suffolk-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Painting**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The other weekend I kept free so I could paint our bedroom. Indecisiveness won and we took the whole weekend to select our paint colour so the actual painting got pushed back but I still felt like painting something. Long story short I pulled out my easel, primed some canvas’ and painted a fun picture for my best buddies new baby’s room. I’d put a picture but it’s still a surprise for her for now so you’ll have to wait.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I really missed painting though, it’s one of my hobbies that always falls off the radar. It was actually so nice to stay in on a Saturday night, have a few beers, sing along to Disney songs and paint. It took me back to my uni days.</span>\n\n![Viki painting](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Viki-painting-576x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Wine tasting**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Last Monday I went along to wine tasting with some of my blogger buddies. I’d been a few years ago and learnt all about swirling the glass and things but was keen to try it out again. We were hosted by Siliva who runs [Divino in Vino](https://www.divinoinvino.co.uk). She’d picked out six indigenous wines for us to try including a prosecco, two whites and three reds. She explained a little bit of the history of each one as she poured them. Two of the wines we tried were originally created from grapes which were almost extinct, making them into wine made them more popular!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I enjoyed each one we tried (mainly because they were wine!) but got quite critical with my scoring. I tried to remain… professional but ended up writing things like ‘smells like mushrooms’ and ‘tastes better after the first glass’ on my scoring sheet. Opps. It was a super fun evening though and a good mix of learning more about wine and having a giggle with the girls.</span>\n\n![wine tasting](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wine-tasting-1024x769.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Dinner at Hixter**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">On Tuesday evening I was double booked. I popped along to the London Bloggers meet up organised by [Abbi](http://upraisedliving.com/) at the Escapologist bar in Covent Garden. I met a whole bunch of bloggers and has a few glasses of fizz before having to scoot off pretty sharpish to get to dinner at Hixter in London Bridge.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Typically I was running late so told Charlie to order for me and boy did good! He ordered the half roast barn-reared chicken with stuffing, chips and gravy and the beef burger for us to both share. YUM! My favourite was the chicken as it was comfort food heaven but he preferred the beef burger which was exactly as rare as we wanted it (aka very rare).</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Date night at Stef’s @ Oregano**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">With all the excitement that was April, Charlie and I realised that we hadn’t had a date for a while. I’d spent the weekend decorating whilst he was coding my website so we deserved a treat for all our hard work. I had a quick Google of islington restaurants (why can I never think of anywhere I want to go when I’m looking?!) and found a few options. We took a walk towards Angel and glanced at the menu of [Stef's](https://www.stefsoregano.co.uk/) before heading inside. I’m so glad we chose it, the food and the service was exactly what we wanted.</span>\n\n![Stef's](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Stefs-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We ordered a giant bottle of beer to share as we planned our meal. I wanted to try everything but we eventually decided on Crostini al Crudo and the seafood linguine for starters (which we both shared) and then the spinach, ham and ricotta calzone and the Paesana pizza (which we also both shared). The food was incredible. I think we’ve just found our new favourite local Italian!</span>\n\n![Stef's Oregano](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Stefs-Oregano-1024x626.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">I wrote about my visit to [Stef’s Oregano](https://www.stefsoregano.co.uk/) in my [roundup post](https://vikibell.com/posts/my-april-highlights) but the meal was so good I thought it justified it's own post too! I'm always a bit stuck for restaurant recommendations whenever someone asks me so I'm trying to build up a bit of a list for myself. I found out about Stef's after a really quick Google for 'food places in Islington'. We had a walk down towards Angel and looked in at a few menus on the way. Stef's stood out to us though as it was just off the main road and seemed welcoming. The biggest issue I had with the meal was the fact that I wanted to try EVERYTHING on the menu. And I mean everything. We took a bazillion years to decide what we actually wanted and even then, we shared each course so we could try double. </span>\n\n![Stef’s Oregano](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Stefs-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We started off with a giant bottle of beer - something I'd not noticed on any other menu before. It was quite fun and tasted good too. We were torn between Salsiccia Toscana (a spicy sausage thing), Fungi Misti (garlic and white wine wild mushrooms) and any of the bruschettas. We eventually picked</span> Crostini al Crudo and a started portion of the seafood linguine (which is usually a main). We had a bottle of the Pinot Grigio alongside it too. ![Stef’s Oregano](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Stefs-Oregano-1024x626.jpg)\n\nFor main we had a spinach, ham and ricotta calzone and the Paesana pizza (anchovies, ham, capers and olives). The food was wonderful and exactly what we wanted. I can't remember the last time we'd been out for a proper Italian (as opposed to grabbing a quick pizza in a pub). Oh, and I should mention the service too, our waiter was really nice and thoughtful. He brought us extra sauce for the calzone when we ran out and even used the table next to us for our wine and water when we ran out of space. All the staff there seemed really happy to be there and that's something that makes a massive difference to my meal. I think Italian is my favourite food to go out for and Stef’s Oregano may just by my new favourite local!",

      "postDate": "2017-05-18 07:49:21",
      "wordpressContent": "<div>Meditation isn’t all zen-like hippy shit. It’s actually very useful for your mind, mental health and focus. It’s something everyone should have a go at once or twice. I started looking into meditation for probably the same reason you did, it became fashionable and I thought ‘what the hell is this? Do I have to sit crossed legged up a mountain or something?!’. After a friend recommended me to the [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) app, I used it a few times, felt good and then got bored. I think I worked through all ten recommended sessions but I didn't do them back to back like you're supposed to. Taking ten minutes out of my day was just too much - yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds but that was my thinking. And this is precisely the reason why you should meditate. This year I’ve been using the [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) app to give me guided meditation sessions and it’s made a big difference to my mind.</div>\n\n<div>![Relaxing sea](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Relaxing-sea-1024x683.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>But firstly, **what is meditation?**</div>\n\n<div>Wikipedia states that _meditation is a practice where an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realise some benefit or for the mind to simply acknowledge its content without becoming identified with that content,__ or as an end in itself._</div>\n\n<div>This is quite interesting as I’ve never actually looked up the definition before. For me I’d say m_editation is a state of calm and relaxing which trains your mind to focus on the present moment. It can help your mind become more positive and focussed as you train to recognise when stress and negativity are trying to take over. It makes you turn off from the past and not worry about the future, it encourages you to be in the present moment and live in it, enjoy it._</div>\n\n<div>**How does it help?**</div>\n\n<div>Taking five or ten minutes of meditation <span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;\">each morning before going to </span><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;\">work helps focus my mind on the tasks I have to do that day. Before I started meditating I’d have a million and one things running through my head and would very easily get distracted. Now, I can zone out from all of those thoughts and focus on one thing at a time. If a thought crops up about something I should do, I simply write it on a post-it to think about later. </span></div>\n\n<div><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;\">It’s also really enjoyable to do. A few times I’ve lit some incense, turned my lights onto blue and sat there silently for a while concentrating on my breathing. I’ve made my own little zen world (okay, maybe this is turning it more into the hippy-shit I mentioned it not being earlier). Thoughts come and go but my focus is on sitting still and enjoying the moment. When my life is pretty much rushing around from one thing to another, this chills me out and gives me time and space to zone out. </span></div>\n\n<div><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;\">Whatever big or small reason you have for trying out meditation for the first time is, just give it a go. if you’re eating healthily and going to the gym then you’re training your body. Why not take some time and train your mind too? One thing to remember whenever you meditate is that some days will be better than others. There’s some mornings when I sit there thinking about how I can’t concentrate and how I’m not turning off all the thoughts buzzing around my brain. This is fine too. Accept that this isn’t the best meditation session you’ve ever had and be okay with that. After all, at least you took the time out and that’s still better for you than nothing. </span></div>\n\n<div><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;\">![Calm photo](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Calm-photo-891x1024.jpg)</span></div>",

      "wordpressContent": "Wow, how is it June already? Where did May go? I mean seriously?! Did someone knock me out for half of the year? I feel like it’s been a grotty winter and then BOOM over the past few weeks the sunshine has been making an (unfashionable late) appearance.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">As I did in April I thought I’d share my May highlights with you. Because it makes me feel damn proud and happy to look back at the fun things I've done.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Gin Garden**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Charlie and I headed down to The Gun in Canary Wharf one evening to check out the opening of their gin garden. As promised there was a lot of gin and other drinks. The garden looked like good fun with grass floor and lawn games. It would have been perfect to sit and have an evening tipple or two (or three) in the sunshine. Except it wasn’t sunny. It was actually bitterly cold. Damn British weather! I’m hoping head back when it’s a little warmer so I can chill out watching the view.</span>\n\n![Gin garden](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gin-garden1-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Brighton weekend**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I had a bit of a spontaneous night out in Brighton with my cousin [Sarah](https://www.instagram.com/cleverwellness/) (if you haven’t checked out her Instagram DO IT, the food she posts will make you start eating all sorts of healthy things). The night was anything but healthy with a whole lot of gin and sweet potato crisps and falafel. Although the morning was my favourite part. After catching only a few hours sleep we both headed down to the [beach](https://www.instagram.com/p/BTzGu4pB7Xe/?taken-by=cleverwellness) to sit and watch the waves. After, we walked around the lanes and grabbed a smoothie from Guaranaco. It was pretty early so the rest of Brighton hadn’t woken up, it felt like we had the town to ourselves, free to explore.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Harry Potter at the Royal Albert Hall**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I have to admit something. Now this may come as a shock but I’m not the biggest Harry Potter fan. And by that I mean I don’t know what house I’m in, I get 0 in any quiz you ask me and haven’t read all of the books. When I was younger I loved the books but I lost interest as I got older and never really made the effort to stay into it. </span><span class=\"s1\">Okay, big reveal over. I headed to the Royal Albert Hall to watch Harry Potter but what I got was a lot more. I knew about the orchestra playing the music live but it was such a cool experience. I was genuinely amazed at how good they were. Even the choir who were oooohing and ahhhhhing at the right sections - it didn’t even sound like humans making those noises! It sounded exactly like the film.</span>\n\n![Harry Potter](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Harry-Potter-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Eat off the menu**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I was invited for dinner with Charley and a bunch of bloggers the other week. We all met at Zayane which is a Moroccan restaurant in Notting Hill. The reason we were there was to try out the food but also to learn more about [Eat of the Menu](https://www.eatoffthemenu.com/). This was started by Alex and aims to scour the city to find the secret dishes served by top restaurants which aren’t on the menu. Each dish has a story behind it and we tried the Zayane’s British twist on a Moroccan classic which was a Bakoula salad with red olives, tomatoes and cod.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Sushi making**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">More food! Last week Charlie and I headed off to Murakumi in Covent Garden for a sushi making lesson. The head chef, Rey Sabinos, taught us how to roll California rolls and make Nigiri. I love making sushi but this was my first proper lesson so I picked up a few tips - mainly how to make the rolls square ([like this lil cutie](https://twitter.com/Vikiibell/status/867091251107069953)). I’ve been meaning to share a post around sushi making so watch this space!</span>\n\n![Sushi](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sushi-1024x731.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Brighton (again) and Southend**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Alongside all of that we’ve finally managed to finish decorating our bedroom (post to come!). We spend most weeknights last week putting our bed back together and putting up wardrobes. We decided to celebrate by getting out of the house and going for a day trip to sunny Brighton. Except it wasn’t sunny at all. In fact it was bloody freezing!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Our luck didn’t change much the next day when we went to Southend to see Charlie’s grandpa for dinner. As soon as we stepped off the train the sky turned into what I can only presume was an attempt at an apocalypse! Still, it was nice to escape London and get out in the fresh air.</span>\n\n![Southend](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Southend-1024x768.jpg)",

Every time we grab a drink or dinner together we always say the standard 'let's do it again' line. Except we don't; does anyone really stick to that line? That's why, when I got asked to check out [Thai Square](https://thaisq.com/), I knew exactly who to take with me, India, the person who introduced me to Thai food. It was the ultimate taste test.</div>\n\n<div>![Thai Square cocktails](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Thai-Square-cocktails-1024x792.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>As we arrived the staff welcomed us with beaming smiles and sat us down at our table with some cocktails. Then the food started to arrive, and boy was there a lot of food. We sampled all of the goodies on Thai Square Platinum set menu which included two starters - aromatic duck rolls followed by Hoi Shell Rad Gang Kiew (thai green scallops). I love duck rolls, in fact, I would have been perfectly happy if the entire meal was just duck rolls. Did I mention that I love duck rolls? Okay good.The scallops were the perfect dish to distract me from the tasty tasty duck rolls. I love scallops but have never had them in thai green sauce before, it was, interesting.</div>\n\n<div>![Duck and scallops](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Duck-and-scallops-919x1024.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>Next up was the mains. We had Green Prawn Curry, Phed Makhem (duck with a tamarind sauce), Stir Fried prawns and Scallops and Weeping Tiger (marinated beef in a secret chilli sauce). Don't forget the sides too! These were egg fried noodles and vegetables, pak choi in a special sauce and steamed jasmine rice. All together that's a lot of food. But a lot of good food.</div>\n\n<div>![Thai Square food](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Thai-Square-food-1024x733.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>I love meals where you can take bits of everything and just share it all. Dinner is so much more fun when you get to taste little bits of everything. That's exactly what we did. Except then we kept eating, and eating, and eating until we were a long way past full but everything was just so damn tasty! We'd worked through everything on the set menu of four courses which for £36.50 each is pretty good value.</div>\n\n<div>In fact I could tell all of the above by the note that I left myself on the way home saying: Thai food = good food!</div>\n\n<div>![Thai Square](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Thai-Square-1024x895.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>If you've been following me on any sort of social media you would have seen various selfies of me covered in paint. We've had a big focus on decorating our bedroom recently. After moving into our flat two years ago we're making headway with the decorating. Slowly. In between getting married, work and having jam packed social lives, it hasn't really been a priority. I finally got my act together and started on the bedroom during the bank holidays (isn't that when everyone does DIY?!). My decorating flow continued and after another weekend and a few late nights, we finally finished it - room three of six! I've taught myself a fair bit about decorating as we've been working through the rooms. It's not exactly a skill they teach you at school is it?! Here's what I've learnt so far:</div>\n\n<div>**Have a plan**</div>\n\n<div>Well duh! That sounds pretty obvious but something which can be overlooked quite easily. We thought about everything we wanted to do with our house pretty soon after we moved in. We had all these grand plans but a silly thing called money stood in the way. No worries, we adapted, skipped the building work section and got straight into planning decorating. We prioritised the rooms which would have the biggest impact on our happiness and started with them.</div>\n\n<div>**Live with your plan**</div>\n\n<div>Having a plan you live with means you've got more time to reflect on it. We wanted to have a red/ orange gradient on our bedroom wall but after trying out some tester pots to pick the right combinations we realised it wasn't going to work. We spend weekends trying out different options but, in the end it wasn’t quite the right feel we were going for. Instead we chose our merlot red colour and painted the entire thing one colour. Also, when you’re looking at paint, make sure you look at it in different lights and different moods. Whilst our gradient looked really fun, after looking at it for a while, we decided it would look too childish.</div>\n\n<div>![Decorated](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Decorated-1024x765.jpg)</div>\n\n<div>**Book your time in **</div>\n\n<div>At work you have deadlines so why not at home? After two years of living in our flat we still haven't finished everywhere. The other week we sat down and physically booked in decorating time so we don't find excuses not to do it. It also means you won't keep putting it off and it'll get done a whole lot quicker, making you feel a whole lot happier!</div>\n\n<div>**Break things down**</div>\n\n<div>We broke down each room into bite size chunks so one weekend we'd prep it for painting, the next we'd paint it and the one after the carpet would arrive. This has made it seem a lot more manageable and it means you don't feel like you're spending ALLLL of your time decorating.</div>\n\n<div>**Appreciate your work**</div>\n\n<div>After painting our merlot wall I had a pretty lazy evening watching Netflix in bed with a glass of wine. I was so happy to be in my new environment. It just felt so good to be chilling in something I'd made!</div>\n\n<div>![Painting](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Painting-1024x768.jpg)</div>",

      "wordpressContent": "I think I’ve just about recovered from Glastonbury. Six days later. I've been to quite a few festivals but this was my first Glastonbury and it was such an amazing experience. If you manage to beat the thousands of people to a ticket then I massively recommend going. It's the biggest festival in the UK and for a good reason.\n\n![Glasto](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Glasto-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">We were camping with quite a big group and being our first year, wanted to make the most out of it, so decided to arrive on Tuesday night. The festival starts at 8am on Wednesday but keen beans tend to camp in their cars (or the entry queue) from Tuesday evening. Being a three hour drive from London, I found this a lot less stressful than having to wake up at silly o’clock to set off and get there early to get a good camping spot. In fact, on the camping spots, this was the first festival I’ve been to where the camp site is in the festival. Usually you’re in an area next to the arenas and have to go through security every time you go in and out. Glastonbury has you sorted though as once you’re in, you’re in. This also means good news on the booze front! .... whatever booze you carry into the campsite, you can also carry around with you during the day. This didn’t stop my buying a cold beer every so often but certainly made it easier to crack open a gin in a tin in the middle of the crowd.</span>\n\n![Glastonbury](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_2108-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">One of the good things about camping with a large group is that you end up going with each other to watch bands you wouldn't usually go to or haven't heard about before. I'd never heard of Nothing But Thieves but ended up seeing them as one of the guys in our group knew the drummer. It was pretty good music and made even better as the drummer jumped into the crowd at the end to hand our camping buddy his drum sticks - cute right?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">One thing I noticed with almost all of the bands I saw was how happy they were to be playing at Glastonbury. It didn’t matter if they were playing at midday in some tiny tent, they were still playing at Glasto. Even the big dogs felt the good vibes; Stormzy looked close to tears when he realised where he was playing!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">My favourite act played on Friday evening which set the weekend off with a bang. It was The Flaming Lips. If you know who they are then you know they have a crazy set. If you don’t know who they are, have a listen but they’re essentially a psychedelic rock band. They opened with confetti cannons and loads of giant balls being thrown out into the crowd. And the colours…. SO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLOURS. As their set continued they brought out people in inflatable suits, Wayne (vocalist) sung on a giant unicorn and then zorbed across the audience. There was inflatable rainbows, giant “yeah signs”, oh and an inflatable sign saying Fuck Yeah Glastonbury. It was all so magical I never wanted it to end.</span>\n\n![The Flaming Lips](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Flaming-Lips-2-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![The Flaming Lips](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Flaming-Lips-1024x768.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A festival isn’t a festival without ‘wavy garms’. Fun clothing is one of the most enjoyable bits of planning for a festival. I ended up making a top at my nan’s house and scraping together all of my ridiculous outfits. Although, I don’t think any of them were quite as ridiculous as Charlie who managed to sport an entire gold outfit including a gold turban one day and his mums old 80's waistcoat and dad’s vibrant hockey shorts the next.</span>\n\n![Glastonbury](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Glastonbury2-1024x770.jpg)\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I could go on and on about how awesome Glastonbury was but it’s something you just need to experience. Everyone said that I would have a good time and I thought yeah, yeah., it’ll be great but it’s just another festival. It’s not. Everyone there is so friendly, there’s so much to discover and explore, it’s like a whole different world away from ‘adult things’ like jobs and being mature. At the end of the five days you never want to leave. I wish the streets of London were full of all the colour, decorations, music, wavy garms and smiles that Glastonbury was.</span>\n\n![Arcadia](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Arcadia-1024x1024.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">This Happy June post is pretty short (and a bit late). I have no idea where the month went but I managed to get some pretty fun things done.</span>\n\n**The Diner, Camden**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I kicked off the summer month at the launch of the rooftop bar at The Diner, Camden. Whenever I past the Angel one, I’d always promised myself I’d go. The food looked damn good so when I got invited to the Camden rooftop opening I could hardly say no. The food lived up to expectations as did the beer - local Camden Town brewery of course! The idea of being sat on a rooftop eating my way through the menu sounds pretty damn tempting right now….</span>\n\n![The-Dinerv2](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Dinerv2-1024x743.jpg)\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Mindful Living Show</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The next big thing on my June to do list was the Mindful living show. It was on during Friday and Saturday which was a little annoying as I could only go on a Saturday (why do these things not know that people have jobs?!). I went along to a talk about happiness which was super useful. It’s something I’ve been sort of on/off researching this year so it was interesting to have a full talk on it and hear some familiar ideas. One of the stand out ideas was around influencing your happiness and also reflecting on the things which make/made you happy<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"></span> - one of the reasons I started these lil roundups.</span>\n\n**Creature Courage **\n\n<span class=\"s1\">On the same day I headed off to face my fears. I’ve been petrified of spiders for years. By this I mean being unable to sleep if I saw one in my house, crying at the sight of them and generally being a big mess for an hour or so after seeing one (no matter what size). It was horrible and I wanted that fear gone. I’d heard about the [Creature Courage](http://creaturecourage.com/) course and got in touch with the owner Britain to find out a bit more. Before I knew it I was booked on and going to defeat my fear. I’ll write about it in more detail soon but for now all you need to know is that I did it! I managed to destroy the fear and even held a tarantula AND a house spider that day - something I never thought I'd be able to do.</span>\n\n![Creature-Courage](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Creature-Courage-2v2-1024x805.jpg)\n\n**<span class=\"s1\">Glastonbury</span>**\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The final big thing I did in June was Glastonbury. The week leading up to it was all about creating those wavy garms. I'd been for Sunday lunch at my nan and grandad’s house so I could borrow the sewing machine. Nan even made me a fun holographic crop top - thanks nan! Before I knew it, I was skipping out of work and packing my bags for a week of fun.

      "postDate": "2017-08-02 07:54:19",
      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">Have you ever been so scared of something that your eyes open up super wide and your heart starts pounding in your chest? Have you ever been so scared that you run away, tears in your eyes, body shaking? Have you ever been so scared that for an hour or so later you’re on edge?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I was exactly that way. I was the person who would walk into a room and spot my fear straight away. I’d keep glancing up at it and if it was too near or moved, I’d leave the room immediately. I’d always be on the lookout and if it ever got mentioned in conversation, I’d swing my legs out from under the table, just in case there was one about.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I’m talking about my ridiculous fear, that same fear that affects around 55% of women and 18% of men. That’s a very large amount of people who are scared of something tiny. Something usually harmless, something that if it didn’t exist we’d likely all die.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Okay, I’ve longed it out enough now and to be honest you could guess what I’m chatting about from the photos anyway. I’m talking about spiders. Those creepy lil buggers that appear literally everywhere. ERGH! I’ve been scared for …. well since I can even remember. There was a giant one in the bath once in my old old old house so that must have been when I was about 3 at least. Even so, Arachnophobia is not funophobia.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I hadn’t thought about doing anything about it before until I spotted that one of my improv coaches had done a course and was now fine. There was a part of me that was intrigued but at the same time absolutely, no way, would ever want to spend an afternoon talking about the beasts, let alone hold one as she was proudly doing. I’ll skip to the end and tell you that I ended up doing the course. I’d been chatting to Britain who runs it and she was super encouraging and kind that I felt more at ease with it all and so I found myself in a crypt near Tottenham Court Road facing my fears on Saturday afternoon.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The course covers all sorts with a cocktail of cognitive therapy, neuro-linguistic programming and hypnotherapy. The hypnotherapy felt that most effective for me but I suspect that it wouldn’t have been so without the rest of the course. I can remember bits of it, maybe because of the amount that I was meditating at the time, but the memories are incredible. I was so relaxed and mentally found myself a happy place.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The end of the course approached quickly and the only part left was the optional part. The part where they bring out the beasts, the spiders. We all stood on one side of the room whilst they prepared everything and then one by one people came up and held a plastic see-through box with a spider inside before moving on to use the capture and release technique (you know when you put a cup over it and use the paper to move it?). I was stood there watching everyone, urging myself to go closer, knowing that it was only me and one other lady left. I felt something wet on my face and realised I was crying. I was literally crying watching a ten year old hold a plastic box. Come on, that’s ridiculous! I took myself away from it all, washed my face, used some of the techniques I’d been taught and came back to the room. I was convinced that I was going to be the one to mess up Britains 100% success rate. SPOILER: I wasn’t. With the help of our therapist Michael I held the spider box! I then went on to do the capture thing with the house spiders. I can’t believe how bloody brave I was!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">The final hurdle was one that would have easily made me sick. I held a tarantula! One of the guys videoed it and even now it makes me cry. You can see the second it touches me and my anxiety and fear disappears and I smile. I showed a few people when I got home and they all said they hadn’t realised my fear before until they saw it raw on my face. I held that bloody tarantula twice as well! Mainly because I didn’t like the first pic I got, because, you know, Instagram…</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">My brain still doesn’t quite know how I did it but I did. And I’ve continued to be fine a few months later. I still notice them when I walk into the room but it doesn’t affect me. I’ve moved them outside when they’re in my way and we even had a giant spider living in our hallway for a few days. Even as we put away our tents at Glastonbury and there were loads of spiders on it, I didn’t care. I can’t believe how much an afternoon has changed my life. Thank you so much Britain and Michael!</span>\n\n![Creature-Courage](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Creature-Couragev2-835x1024.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "<span class=\"s1\">It’s August and you know what that means… birthday month!! But first, I’m looking back at some of the fun things I got up to in July.</span> **<span class=\"s1\">Board games in the garden</span>** <span class=\"s1\">We don't often get to spend time at home during the summer weekends but when we do we love it. A chance to chill out was exactly what we needed after a busy June and we made the most of it by making a den in the garden. We're still getting around to buying garden furniture so instead take out our giant pillows and lounge about on the floor. I mixed up a cocktail or two whilst Charlie BBQ'd our food.</span> **<span class=\"s1\">Gypsy caravanning</span>** <span class=\"s1\">A bit of a spur of the moment decision, I ended up staying in a gypsy caravan one weekend with my sister in law. It was in this really cute campsite near the Downs called Bluebell wood. They have regularly camping spots as well as fun places to sleep in like a bus, RAF helicopter and of course a gypsy caravan. There's loads of pubs within walking distance so we spent most of our time walking between them in the sunshine. As we go up to Suffolk quite a lot, I don't really think about exploring other places in the UK, it was loads of fun to see a different part for once. Oh and we saw sheep! </span> ![Blubell woods](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Blubell-woods-e1502035837799-849x1024.jpg)\n\n<div>**Mango Tree **</div>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">After hearing a lot about Mango Tree from the likes of [Erica](http://www.imbeingerica.com/2017/04/eight-things-you-need-to-try-at-mango.html) and [Milly](http://mini-adventures.com/2017/03/mango-tree-thai-restaurant-belgravia.html) I was intrigued to try it out. It was as if they read my mind and suddenly an invitation was in my inbox. Charlie and I tucked into delicious cocktails as we read through the menu. It's one of those places where it’s more fun to go as a group so you can try out more of the food; I liked the sound of loads of stuff on the menu! Under the waiters recommendation we went for sharing satays and chilli prawns followed by Wagyu beef and pineapple rice. As a massive steak fan I was most interested to try the Wagyu beef as it was such a trend a while back. My thoughts: it was good but not worth the hype or the price tag. ![Mango-Tree-Starter](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mango-Tree-Starter-1024x683.jpg)</span> **<span class=\"s1\">Latitude!</span> ** <span class=\"s1\">This is now pretty much an [annual trip](https://admin.vikibell.com/latitude-festival/) for me and my in-laws. It falls pretty neatly on our wedding anniversary so we all head to Suffolk for a bit of a boogie. I didn't recognise a lot of this years lineup so make sure I played them in the weeks on the run up. Turns out they were all pretty good! One of my highlights was listening to Leon Bridges sing his groovy tunes as the sun set. Oh and of course the headlines, Mumford and Sons! </span> ![Latitude](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Latitude2-1024x770.jpg) <span class=\"s1\">I've said it before and I'll say it again, Latitude is a pretty perfect day festival. There's a whole range of ages (I even saw a four week old baby this year) and everyone is pretty jolly. Although we stuck to music this year, there's comedy, poetry and literature tents too so there's pretty much something for everyone. </span> ![latitude-small](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/latitude-small-1024x804.jpg) **<span class=\"s1\">Barcelona</span> ** <span class=\"s1\">I went to Barcelona at about the same time [last year](https://admin.vikibell.com/barcelona/) and loved it. This time I went as a surprise trip for my aunts birthday. My two aunts, cousins and nan set off early one Friday morning and packed in a whole load of fun for the weekend. I was keen to see some different things but it was also quite nice to go to a destination and already know your way around. After a bit of a wild night out on Friday with one of my cousins, we headed off to Sitges which is a nearby town. I’d 100% come back and see it again properly. It’s about an hour outside of Barcelona (by train) and seems really pretty and peaceful. There were loads of bars around the marina and plenty of shops in the cute winding streets.</span> ![Sitges](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sitges--1024x1024.jpg) <span class=\"s1\">One thing I love about Barcelona is the food! I had to take everyone to Llamber as I loved it so much last time, this time did not disappoint either. On the first night we went to a place called Sensei Tapas which was recommended and it was quite possibly the best tapas I have ever had.</span>   **<span class=\"s1\">Weddings and parties</span>** <span class=\"s1\">We finished off July in style with my aunts birthday party and our school friends wedding. It was a jam packed fun weekend but I loved the opportunity I had to dress up. I hardly ever faff about doing my makeup and hair but for both occasions I was able to take some time and actually enjoy getting ready to go out.</span> ![Wedding](https://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Wedding-1024x770.jpg)",

      "wordpressContent": "<div>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Teenage Viki spent hours setting up and playing around with profiles/ blogs on MySpace, Bebo and Piczo. Looking back now it was pretty obvious that I was going to start blogging at some point; I just didn’t know it until two and a bit years ago.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I started this blog because it was all too easy to stay home watching Netflix. I wanted fun adventures and excitement and to meet new people. Since starting [<span class=\"s2\">vikibell.com</span>](http://vikibell.com) I’ve kept track of all the weird and wonderful things I get up to. This has included getting [married](http://admin.vikibell.com/wedding-day-part-i/), traveling to [various places](https://vikibell.com/categories/travel) around the world, eating a LOT of [food](https://vikibell.com/categories/food). Oh, and random thoughts such as what I would do if there was a [zombie apocalypse](https://vikibell.com/posts/survive-zombie-apocalypse) (because a girl can never be too prepared right?)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Who is Viki Bell?**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Good question, here’s a little bit of background… I grew up in Essex before heading off to the University of Leeds to study Art & Design. I now live in London with my husband [Charlie](https://charliejackson.com/) and work in social media.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I’ve picked up random hobbies along the way such as painting, photography, improv comedy and [jewellery making](http://admin.vikibell.com/making-jewellery/). I LOVE trying out new things and will give anything a go once!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Describe yourself in three words**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Ginger, energetic, creative</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**What makes you happy?**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Sunsets and sunshine, music, Suffolk, photography, gin, improv, painting, pizza, being silly, steak, kittens, swimming, champagne and that moment you step off an aeroplane in a new destination.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>**Working with me**</div>\n\n<div>I'm always happy to hear from brands and PRs but will only cover a topic if it fits in with VikiBell.com and I like it. I do not accept third party content. All images on this blog are taken by me unless otherwise stated. I will always disclose if a product, service etc. was gifted to me.</div>\n\n<div>Have some more questions for me to answer? Swing me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/vikiibell), message on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vikibellblog/) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vikibell/) or give me an email at _vikibell[at]me.com_.</div>\n\n<div>![IMG_1221](http://admin.vikibell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_12211-768x1024.jpg)</div>"
